It's been a bit more than a week since I posted the last "weekly progress".

Today's news is that because me (the project tracker) was busy attending for the Aspose.Words for .NET 9.4 release and also reviewing and integrating new features onto our trunk (I posted about these) - there is no measurable progress on the Autoporting to Java project to report today.

This is not to say there was no progress done on the Java project. We have been reviewing and reworking our XML parsing in Aspose.Words for Java to make it ready to support some of the more advanced XML parsing features required for full DrawingML support.

I was delaying this post because I was hoping to catch up and report the measured progress, but the customers keep asking about it, so I decided to post today, but skip the actual figures.
