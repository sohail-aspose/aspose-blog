Aspose has released **version 1.1** of its Eclipse IDE plugin to support the new Aspose for Java product family along with a numbers of revamps in the plugin features including many UI enhancements that improve the user experience. With this release, the plugin adds support for the new Aspose.Tasks and Aspose.Diagram for Java APIs.

### Aspose.Tasks for Java

[![Aspose.Tasks for Java logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/12/aspose-Tasks-for-Java_100.png)Aspose.Tasks for Java is a project management API that enables Java application developers to provide Microsoft Project® document manipulation capability in their applications – all without using Microsoft Project®. With this powerful API, developers can control various stages of project management, such as project planning, definition and tracking.

### Aspose.Diagram for Java

It provides better performance and is easier to use to manipulate diagrams and convert files than Microsoft Office Automation.
