We are very much excited to announce a maintenance release of Aspose.PDF for Reporting Services 3.0.0 which provides fixes for issues reported in earlier release versions. Text justification is one of the features provided by Aspose.PDF for Reporting Services which is not supported by Microsoft Report Viewer or Report Server's default PDF rendering feature. With the addition of a [simple custom feature][1] either in a particular report or by defining a configuration on the Report server, you can output text with justified or fully justified alignment when rendering reports to PDF or XPS format. In this new release, we have particularly fixed the text alignment feature when rendering a report in local mode using Microsoft Report Viewer 2010.

Please get the download and start exploring the exciting new release of [Aspose.PDF for Reporting Services 3.0.0][2].
