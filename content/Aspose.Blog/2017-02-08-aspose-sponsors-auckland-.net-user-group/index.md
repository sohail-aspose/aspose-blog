The [Auckland .NET user group][2] is a bi-monthly meetup of around 60-100 different members each month. Topics discussed included e topics include any part of the .NET framework, web technology or Windows apps.

Aspose loves getting behind developers in the community which is why we are sponsoring the Auckland .NET user group. We recommend if you are in in the neighbourhood to go [check them out][3].

## What's in Store?

Mob Programming and Xamarin -

[Mark Pearl][4], a dev lead at MYOB, has offered to share some of the experiences his team has had over the last 6 months with Mob Programming. He'll cover the benefits, techniques they have used, and some of the challenges they’ve faced.

The second talk will be Xamarin 102 - a slightly deeper dive into Xamarin. It’s hard to be a .NET developer and not have heard of Xamarin. It’s now part of Microsoft’s ‘Any developer, any platform’ strategy, and allows you to write C# code that runs on iOS and Android.
