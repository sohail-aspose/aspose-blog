[![jDays 2013, November 26-27, Gothenburgh, Sweden][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/11/jDays_banner_250x250.png)Aspose sponsors a range of user groups and conferences in the US, Europe and Asia. In previous posts, we've highlighted some of the .NET events that we support. .NET is only one of our platforms: we also support events for our other platforms, for example SharePoint, and Java.

Later this month, on November 26-27, jDays 2013, a Java developer conference, takes place in Gothenburg, Sweden. It's a chance for Java developers in Scandinavia and beyond to get together, learn about current trends and exchange ideas.

Here's what the organizers say about the conference:

"Interested in Java and Open Source? Then jDays is for you!

Now it's time to sign up for jDays, the Java Developer Conference in Gothenburg! Besides the many interesting presentations in Java and Open Source, we are listening to the keynotes from the UML and RUP father Ivar Jacobson. It is guaranteed to be entertaining 2 days and well worth a visit."

You can find out more and register at [www.jdays.se][2].

We're delighted to sponsor the conference. Conferences and user groups play an important role in developers' ongoing professional development. Software's not an industry where you can afford to stop learning - that's what makes it so rewarding.

If you want to find out more about the groups we sponsor, check out the [Community section][3] of the website. If you have a group you think we should sponsor, [contact us][4]. We'd love to hear from you!
