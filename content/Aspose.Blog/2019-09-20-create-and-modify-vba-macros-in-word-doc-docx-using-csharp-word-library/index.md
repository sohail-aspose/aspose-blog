## Create Repeating Section Content Control in Word Document

MS Word allows you to insert the repeating content control with XML mapping in Word document. You can insert repeating content control around entire paragraphs or table rows. We have added this feature in the latest release of Aspose.Words. A new enumeration type _RepeatingSectionItem_ has been added in this release.

## LINQ Reporting with XML, JSON, and CSV Data Sources

As you know, LINQ Reporting Engine enables you to build reports using an extended set of reporting features. The engine enables you to reference business objects of your application in report templates. We have added XmlDataSource, JsonDataSource, and CsvDataSource classes in this release to use XML, JSON, and CSV as data sources to generate reports using LINQ Reporting. Please read the following articles for complete detail of this feature.

## Link Custom Document Property to Bookmark

MS Word allows you to link custom document property to a bookmark. In MS Word, you can check this option under document properties dialog. In this release, we have added LinkSource and IsLinkToContent properties in DocumentProperty class and a method AddLinkToContent in CustomDocumentProperties class. The following code example shows how to link custom document property to a bookmark.

## Remove License.IsLicensed property

The License.IsLicensed obsolete property has been removed in order to increase anti-hacking resistance. Moreover, this property was useless because of the License.SetLicense method. This method throws an exception in case of a wrong license key.

## Introduced SavePictureBullet option for MS Word 97 Document

We have added DocSaveOptions.SavePictureBullet property in this release to work with PictureBullet data. This option is provided for MS Word 97 which cannot work correctly with PictureBullet data. Please set this option to "false" to remove PictureBullet data.

We recommend you please check the release notes of [Aspose.Words for .NET 19.9][7] for complete detail of API changes.
