[![][1]](http://www.aspose.com/java/email-component.aspx)We are pleased to share that Aspose.Email for Java 4.4.0 has been released and contains a number of enhancements in addition to fixes to bugs reported by our customers. This latest version is available for download from our [product download][2] page. You can contact us in case of any feedback or inquiry on the [Aspose.Email forum][3].

## Capability to Add Attachments to Outlook Journal Items

Ported from the .NET API, Aspose.Email for Java 4.4.0 provides the capability to add attachments to Outlook Journal items. The earlier versions of Aspose.Email API lacked this facility as well as saving journal item to disc. This month’s release also enables application developers to save the Outlook journal item to disc as MSG file.

## Enhanced Distribution List Properties

Aspose.Email for Java already supports creating Outlook distribution list comprised of multiple contacts. However, setting the distribution list subject and body was missing until now. We are pleased to share that this month’s release provides the capability to set these properties for a distribution list. This makes the feature more complete in resemblance to the same feature as provided by Microsoft Outlook.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

As always, we try our best to fix issues reported by our customers. This month’s release also fixes a number of bugs. These include:

*   Failure to process certain MSG files.
*   Date format issues while converting email messages to MHTML.
*   Exceptions raised while loading some MSG files.

You can further visit the Public API changes page of our documentation for details of all API changes in this version.
