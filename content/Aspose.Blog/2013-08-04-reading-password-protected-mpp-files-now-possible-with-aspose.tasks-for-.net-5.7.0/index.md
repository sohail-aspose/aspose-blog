[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Tasks-for-net_100.png)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Tasks 5.7.0.

With this month's release, all non-generic collections have been replaced with strongly typed and, hence, we don't support .NET framework anymore with all occurrences of ArrayList replaced with List<T> as well.

This month's release also provides the facility of reading password protected files in 2003 format. The Project's class overloaded constructor enables users with loading password protected files. In case a wrong password is provided, TaskReadingException is thrown.

We have also made a number of enhancements in this release. This version now provides the facility of scheduling of a project from finish or start date. In addition, we have performed some internal refactoring to the recalculations performed and methods, like Task.Recalculate(), are more efficient, hence, improving the performance.

This month's release also includes a number of bug fixes reported by our value customers/users from time to time. For more details on new features and bug fixes, please visit the [Product Release Page][2].
