We recently added a new technical article in Aspose.BarCode for Java documentation. It features inserting barcode images in Eclipse BIRT reports using Aspose.BarCode for Java, Eclipse IDE and BIRT runtime. The report is first designed in Eclipse using BIRT report designer plug-in. We added an image in the report and later dynamically inserted the barcode images in report.
