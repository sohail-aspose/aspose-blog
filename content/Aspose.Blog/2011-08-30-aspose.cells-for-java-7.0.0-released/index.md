![Aspose.Cells icon][1]

This product has almost the same features/APIs as Aspose.Cells for .NET. We actually wanted the two products (Aspose.Cells for .NET and Aspose.Cells for Java) to be same as possible but to achieve this we had to manually port the .NET product using line by line for the APIs set to Java. This was very time consuming task but our developers continuously worked on the task to make it possible. To get the two products in line, we developed a process for porting the .NET product to Java automatically.

The process of auto-porting Aspose.Cells for .NET to Java started some months ago. We are now pleased to release Aspose.Cells for Java v7.0.0. This is the first release in which we have automatically ported from our .NET code and therefore, it contains several features that were missing in the previous Aspose.Cells for Java versions.

## Better for you, better for us

This release is a major milestone because from now on we can work more efficiently and it means a much better Aspose.Cells for Java for you. The reason for this is that we can now maintain two products - Aspose.Cells for Java and Aspose.Cells for .NET - from a single source code base. From now on the two products include almost the same set of features, fixes and are released on the same day.

## New features and enhancements

There are a lot of new features in Aspose.Cells for Java, although not all of the Aspose.Cells for .NET features has made it available, but a huge number of features have been made available. Here are some of the features/enhancements that make this product extra special.

*   Separate compiled versions of the product for different JDKs, e.g. 1.4, 1.5, 1.6
*   Set formulas with external references
*   Support ListObjects / Tables
*   Support AutoShapes Objects
*   Enhancements are made for Shape-to-Image feature
*   Enhancements are made for Chart-to-Image feature
*   Enhancements are made for Sheet-to-Image feature
*   Enhancements are made for Excel-to-PDF feature
*   Enhancements are made for Auto-Fit Rows/Columns feature

## Known issues and limitations

There are a number of known limitations in this release. There are a few features that might not be supported in v7.0.0 that were actually supported in the older versions:

For example,

*   Using LightCells APIs
*   Reading HTML files
*   Reading/Saving Charts/Shapes for ODS files
*   Preserving Macros when reading ODS file and save Macros back to ODS file

Moreover, in this release, we have renamed certain APIs set to clean the API structure to match it with Aspose.Cells for .NET. We changed the names of some classes and other members accordingly. Due to these changes, if you are an existing user, you may need to update/fix certain parts of your existing code segments when upgrading from your previous version of Aspose.Cells for Java. All of the same functionality remains intact, only access to some members has been shifted, renamed or merged into other methods.

## What is next?

We are continuously working on improving it to make sure that the new version works 100% fine with all the previous issues (that were fixed in the previous versions/fixes of the product for the existing users). We need more time to evaluate them all and make the product more robust. We also encourage you all to evaluate your previous issues with this new release in your diverse environments. Please feel free to notify us any issue using the Aspose.Cells forum. Your co-operation in this regard is highly appreciated.

**Edit \[14th February, 2012\]:** Aspose.Cells for Java is ported automatically from Aspose.Cells for .NET using a magical code porting tool which we use internally.
