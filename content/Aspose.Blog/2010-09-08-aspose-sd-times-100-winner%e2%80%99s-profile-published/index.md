**USA, Texas – September 08, 2010** **–** Building Microsoft Office functionality into .NET and Java applications is a major priority for developers in many businesses. With that in mind, Aspose’s Aspose.Total Component Suites offer flexibility to help you with this requirement at an affordable price. Aspose was named to the 2010 SD Times 100, which lists the top leaders and innovators in the software development industry.

“_Each Aspose.Total suite includes every product built for Java and .NET technology platforms_,” says John Owens, Associate Director for Europe at Aspose. “_For example, Aspose.Total for .NET packages up every .NET component that we offer. We compile the suite daily to ensure that it contains the latest, most up-to-date version of each of our .NET components. An added bonus is that, as well as getting every component that is currently available for either technology platform, you will also be entitled to use any new product we release for that platform during your subscription period. It really is a total solution_.”"

So starts the 2010 SD Times 100 Winner’s Profile for Aspose. We are pleased to have received the award and will continue to work to delight our customers in the coming year. Our development efforts are lead by our customer’s needs. We are happy that the SD Times has recognised our efforts to lead the way in the components market.

The SD Times 100 are awarded by the SD Times’ editors and readers to companies, non-profit organisation, open source projects or other initiatives in software that shows innovation and leadership. Aspose are delighted to be on the list of Components & Libraries again. The SD Times 100 is not a product award but awards leadership in a variety of software development industry areas.
