Sydney, Australia – November, 11th 2009 – At Aspose we are continually listening to the needs of our customers as well as looking for new ways to provide better value for money, so today we are pleased to announce a great new way to purchase our products - The Aspose Product Family purchasing option.

The Product Family purchasing option offers customers an easy way to buy our products across all supported technology platforms for one low purchase price.

For example, previously, when building a solution that required both Aspose.Words for .Net and Aspose.Words for Reporting services, customers would have had to purchase each of these components seperately.

From today, customers can simply buy the new Aspose.Words Product Family option, this package includes all Aspose.Words components including, Aspose.Words for .Net, Aspose.Words for Java, Aspose.Words for Reporting Services and Aspose.Words for JasperReports.

Product Family options are available for all our main product lines and pricing starts from $649, more details can be found here - [http://www.aspose.com/corporate/purchase/faqs/product-family-questions.aspx][1]
