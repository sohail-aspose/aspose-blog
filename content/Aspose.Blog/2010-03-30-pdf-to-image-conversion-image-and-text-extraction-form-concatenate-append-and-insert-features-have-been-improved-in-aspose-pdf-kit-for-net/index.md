Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET 4.3.0 has been published. In this new version, PDF to PNG conversion, text rendering on the converted images, image and text extraction, filling text and image fields have been improved. We have also enhanced adding images and PDF file security related features.  
  
Memory utilization and performance have been improved for the Concatenate, Append and Insert methods. However, if you want to perform these operations on a large number of files, we would recommend you to use files as an array instead of using memory streams to get better results.  
  
It is not uncommon to use Adobe Reader Extensions for PDF Forms; we have enhanced Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET to support reader extensions. Now, you can use the Form.Save() method to save the filled form while keeping the reader extensions enabled, instead of using the second overload with SaveOptions parameter; this overload is deprecated.Â   
  
You can see the complete list of changes and download the latest version from the [Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET download section][1].
