The Aspose .NET Update Export Tool is an open-source tool to be used with Microsoft Dynamics CRM. This tool is used when sometimes it is harder to create/update data in records directly in CRM. It can save effort in terms of time and money. Simply, export the data from any entity and any field on your desktop in Excel, and you can easily handle or update the data in excel. Once data is updated, import it back to CRM from excel. This tool can be used online and on-premises as well.
