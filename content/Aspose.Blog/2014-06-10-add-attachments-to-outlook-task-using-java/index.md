## Adding Attachments to Outlook Tasks using Java

Aspose.Email for Java already lets you create, save and read an Outlook task. This feature was further enhanced by adding reminder information to the task. We have now further enhanced working with Outlook tasks so that users can now add attachments to Outlook task as well.

## Creating a Message with Voting Options

With the release of Aspose.Email for .NET 4.2.0, we have introduced a new feature that lets you create an email message with voting options. We are pleased to share that the same feature, creating email message with voting options, has also been implemented in this version of Aspose.Email for Java.  Users can now:

*   Create a new message with a poll.
*   Read voting options from an existing message.
*   Add voting options to an existing message.
*   Delete voting options from an existing message.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

As always, we have fixed a number of issues reported by our customers for previous version of Aspose.Email for Java. In addition, since each version of Aspose.Email for Java is auto-ported from its equivalent .NET version, all the bug fixes in the .NET version are also part of the latest version.  These include:

*   Issues related to adding messages to a PST.
*   Encoding issues while message conversion to other formats.
