This is a maintenance release that contains a couple of enhancements and fixes for issues reported in earlier versions. In this version we have enhanced the PDF template feature support to SharePoint subsites as well, so that it can export lists. Please check the export and import template feature details for more information. We have resolved  the TIFF image to PDF conversion issue in this release.
