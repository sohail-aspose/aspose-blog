**Sydney, Australia - 1 July, 2011 -** [Aspose.Pdf for .NET][2] and Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET can be used separately or together to create and edit PDF files. Aspose.Pdf for .NET allows developers to create PDF files from within their applications while Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET allows them to edit existing PDF documents. Both products are included in [Aspose.Total for .NET][3], Aspose's complete file management .NET program suite and are often used with other Aspose products.

# Ongoing development

Aspose.Pdf and Aspose.Pdf.Kit were developed in response to two customer groups' very different needs. Over time, as the products have developed and more customers started using them, some features started to converge. Increasingly, our users want to perform advanced tasks and document management that involves creating files from scratch or changing existing files. Duplicating features means either duplicating work, which is inefficient, or code, which can be difficult to maintain. Duplicating features between the two products also weakened the case for maintaining two separate products.

To make sure that our products are the best on the market we decided to merge the two products into one.

# Introducing Aspose.Pdf for .NET 6.0

Aspose.Pdf for .NET 6.0 brings together the powerful features of Aspose.Pdf for .NET and Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET. We have been excited about this development for some time and have been preparing our users through regular updates in out blogs:

*   Download Aspose.Pdf for .NET 6.0 (and read the release announcement).
*   Migrate existing Aspose.Pdf for .NET code to the merged API (video tutorial)
*   Find out how to make the most of the updated documentation

As part of the work on merging the two products we have introduced a DOM-based API so that the merged product has even more flexible editing features than the previous products. Migration to the new product is easy: it is important that the changes do not slow you down but instead give you a more powerful tool to work with. Improvements to the PDF engine ensure that this is the case.

# Maintaining previous products

It is Aspose's policy to support superceded products for a while after the release of a new product. Aspose.Pdf for .NET 5.n and Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET 5.n are supported and will receive occasional updated until they are discontinued in early October. We strongly recommend that our users migrate to Aspose.Pdf for .NET 6.0 - the merged product - as soon as possible to benefit from the new features. All customers with [valid subscriptions][4] can download, install and start using the merged product immediately.

Download Aspose.Pdf for .NET 6.0.
