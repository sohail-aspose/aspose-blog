[Aspose.Tasks for .NET][1] 6.0.0 has been released with a number of new features, enhancements and bug fixes.

With this month's release, Aspose.Tasks supports exporting project data to CSV, TXT and popular Microsoft Excel formats like XLS and XLSX. Using Aspose.Tasks, a project's tasks, resources and assignment data can be exported to CSV, TXT, XLS and XLSX formats with ease. In addition, saving project data as a Microsoft Project Template (MPT) is also supported.

## Create a Project with Default Properties

A great feature that lets you create a project from scratch with default properties is also supported in this month’s release. This lets developers avoid initializing all data properties as in the case of MSP.

This month’s release also includes a number of bug fixes reported by our users. For further information, please visit the [Product Release Page][2].
