We have published the latest version of Aspose.PDF for Java. In Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java 3.6.0, we have introduced a new feature to highlight text in a PDF file. The replaceText method can be used to highlight the text by setting its background color.

We have also improved the PdfContentEditor and TextProperties classes. Text replacement, adding footer and page number features have also been enhanced. You can see the complete list of changes and download the latest version from the [Aspose.PDF for Java download section.][1]
