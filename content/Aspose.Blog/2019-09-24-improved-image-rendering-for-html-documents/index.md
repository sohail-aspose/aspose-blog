Image rendering is one of the most widely used feature of Aspose.HTML for .NET API. We have further enhanced this feature with latest release. It enables you to render high fidelity images of your HTML documents. Another amazing addition in Aspose.HTML for .NET API is the support for CSS Drop Shadows. We have also resolved some problems related to text alignment in table cells. Few internal bug fixes have been incorporated and an error pertaining to MHT to XPS conversion is also resolved in the API. These enhancements and feature inclusions make this API a best fit for your applications.

A more closer overview of this release can be found in [Release Notes][1] and working examples can be found in [Example Project][2]. We value and appreciate your feedback that helps us to keep improving the API, so your feedback and suggestions are welcome in [Aspose.HTML forum][3].
