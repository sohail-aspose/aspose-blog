The database packaged with the installer is created on a Microsoft XP Professional which supports multi-language, if you got a "collating sequence not supported by operating system" error, please create a new database using the scripts inclued in the installer package.

Sorry for inconvenience.

Here is a link from Microsoft website talking about the problem.
