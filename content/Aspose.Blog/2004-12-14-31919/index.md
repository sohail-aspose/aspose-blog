Already the Aspose Business Policy section is beginning to grow.  Today we added our refund policy.  If you have purchased an Aspose component and are not fully satisfied within the first 30 days, we will completely refund your money.  Customer satisfaction is (and will always be) our number one concern.

In order to help prevent refund situations, please know that all Aspose components offer a [risk free trial version][1].  Furthermore, we are willing to provide free technical support even prior to the point of purchase.  We are committed to ensuring that our products will fully meet your needs before you spend any money.

As always, if there are things that we can be doing to make business with Aspose easier… never hesitate to ask.  Feel free to email me directly at [danny.cooper@aspose.com][2].
