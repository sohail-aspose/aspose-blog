[Aspose.Email for .NET][1] 3.8.0 has been released with new features, enhancements and bug fixes.

Organizations sometimes use proxy servers within their premises for controlled access to the digital world outside. This requires mail client configurations, like specifying the proxy server address, that otherwise fail to communicate via the proxy server in absence of such information. Our customers have asked us to support this behavior and we are pleased to share that this month’s release supports configuring proxy server settings for SOCKS4, SOCKS4a and SOCKS5 protocol in mail clients. The following articles can be referred to for detailed working examples.

*   [Send Email via Proxy Server using SMTP][2]
*   [Retrieve Email via Proxy Server using POP3][3]
*   [Retrieve mailbox via Proxy Server using IMAP][4]

Sometimes, a PST contains a handful of corrupt messages, as well as normal messages. This has a negative effect on reading even the non-corrupted messages from the file. We have addressed this issue and enhanced the overall messages reading capability from such a semi-corrupt PST in this month's release.

This month’s release also includes a number of bug fixes related to multilanguage email encodings, inline images display, MapiCalendar scheduling and some attachment issues. We have also fixed some issues related to messages conversion to various formats such as EML and TIFF which further adds to the API's overall functionality.
