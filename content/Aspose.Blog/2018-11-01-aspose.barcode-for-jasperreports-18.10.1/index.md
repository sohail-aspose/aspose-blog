We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.BarCode for JasperReports][1] 18.10.1.Â This release addresses the instance reusability issue of the BarCodeReader.  
To view a complete list of fixes, please visit [Aspose.Barcode for JasperReport 18.10.1 release notes][2] page.

## Enhancements in BarCodeReader

Before this release, if you wanted to scan two or more Barcodes, you had to create new instances of the BarCodeReader to scan other Barcodes. This release of Aspose.Barcode for JasperReports addresses that issue. Now you can scan multiple Barcodes using the same instance of the BarCodeReader.
