We are happy to release a new version of Aspose.Network for Java 2.2. In this version, we added support for reading and writing messages from/to MBOX file. MBOX file is a popular format to store email messages and it is used by Mozilla Thunderbird and some other email clients.

We also added support to read and write VCARD files, which is a popular format to store contact information.
