We have recently released a new version of Aspose.Network for .NET v5.9. In this version, we have included the API for interacting with Twitter. Now, you can use Twitter in your applications using Aspose.Network for .NET.

  

Here are some articles that will get you started on using the Twitter client.

*   General Information about Twitter Client
*   Authorizing the Application with Twitter
*   [Update Status Information on Twitter][1]

More articles on twitter client will be added soon.

  

We also added some new properties in ExchangeMessageInfo to make it more usable for developers. Some bugs were also fixed, which were posted on our forums by customers.
