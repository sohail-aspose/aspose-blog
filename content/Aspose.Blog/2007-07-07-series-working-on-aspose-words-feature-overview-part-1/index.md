Currently, [Aspose.Words Documentation][1] includes a description of all the exciting Aspose.Words feature in a single table. This is historical. Aspose.Words 1.0 was released in 2003 with a pretty small set of features and using a simple table to describe it all was sufficient. After that, due to rapidly rising popularity we've been so busy on Aspose.Words development that some essential areas such as marketing documentation (for example Feature Overview) suffered from the lack of our attention.

We are currently working to update Aspose.Words marketing documentation and thought it would be a good idea to publish new topics as they become available. If you are a potential or existing customer, please feel free to comment or ask questions.

This is the first topic in the series of updates that will later become the new Aspose.Words Feature Overview.
