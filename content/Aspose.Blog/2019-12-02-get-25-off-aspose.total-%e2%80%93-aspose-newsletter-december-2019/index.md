##### Code Example: Read the whole length of the barcode with Aspose.BarCode for .NET

There was an issue while reading whole length of the barcode as the whole text was not read and the partial text was returned by the Aspose.BarCode API. A detailed investigation was done and it was observed that current wiped bar restoration works for NBase only, and need changes which could be implemented for WBase based barcodes. Another problem was the absence of checksum in Code39 barcodes, which was not allowing to check if the result is correct. All these issues were resolved by enabling the wiped bars option. [Read more details here][21].
