We are pleased to announce our new product Aspose.Diagram for .NET Aspose.Diagram is a class library for working with Microsoft Visio files. It allows developers to work with VSD and VDX files on ASP .NET web applications, web services and Windows applications. It allows you to open files and manipulate the elements of the diagram, from lines and fills, to more complex elements, and then export to VDX. The class library is an alternative to the Microsoft Visio Object Model and provides a better performance. The API is extensible, easy to use and compact. It provides common functionality so that developers have to write less code when performing common tasks. Please check Aspose.Diagram for .NET documentation for more details.
