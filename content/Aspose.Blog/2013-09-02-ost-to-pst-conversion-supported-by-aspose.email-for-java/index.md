[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/aspose-Email-for-Java_100.png)Aspose.Email for Java 3.3.0 has been released, with a number of bug fixes and enhancements.

Like its equivalent .NET version Aspose.Email for .NET 3.3.0, Aspose.Email for Java now supports OST to PST conversion. It only takes a line of code to save the loaded OST file as PST and vice versa.

This month’s release has also enhanced the capability of PST operations where users can now change a folder’s Container class after creating it. This enables users to view all the contents of the folder, that contains items of different types (messages, appointments, etc.), in Outlook by changing the folder’s container class to IPF.NOTE, for example.

This month’s release also includes a number of bug fixes related to message encoding, MSG conversion to MHTML, and MapiCalendar  issue while having attachments.

To get further details about what is new and fixed, read the release notes on [Aspose.Email for Java][2] release page.
