Just tested that Aspose.Words for .NET 6.6 installs and demos run on:

*   Windows 7 RC
*   Visual Studio 2010 Beta 1
*   .NET Framework 4.0

Below a screenshot of a Vritual PC running Windows 7, Visual Studio 2010 and the Aspose.Words web demo application rendered a document for viewing in a browser.

  
  
Just a reminder that Aspose.Words for .NET is shipped with two assemblies _net1.1\\Aspose.Words.dll_ and _net2.0\\Aspose.Words.dll_. The former is to be used when building applications for .NET Framework 1.1 (and even 1.0 is supported!). The latter is to be used when building applications targeting .NET Framework versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.5 or 4.0.

It is also wortwhile to note that Aspose.Words.dll is built using the Any CPU platform tagget and thus you can use Any CPU or x86 or x64 platform target setting in your project. Thus with Aspose.Words you can build a x86, x64 or platform agnostic application.
