Aspose.PDF product family is one of our award-winning APIs for PDF document creation and manipulation. One of the main APIs in this family is Aspose.PDF for .NET. For some time now, it has supported converting PDF files to XPS format and vice versa. As Aspose.PDF for Reporting Services is built on top of Aspose.PDF for .NET, the latest release of [Aspose.PDF for Reporting Services 2.7.0][1], now has the feature to directly export RDL files to XPS format, either using Report Server or from a Business Intelligence Development Studio project. So now you can either export RDL files to PDF or XPS format with great fidelity.

Once the component is properly configured (using the MSI installer or manually), the **XPS via Aspose.PDF** option becomes available. Please take a look at the screenshot below.
