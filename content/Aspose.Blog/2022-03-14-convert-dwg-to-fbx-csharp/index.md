## DWG to FBX Conversion – C# API Installation {#section1}

[Aspose.CAD for .NET][5] API can be used to work with DWG, PCL, and several other [file formats][6]. In order to configure the API, you can download its DLL file from the [New Releases][7] section or use the [NuGet][8] installation command below:

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.CAD
```

## Convert DWG to FBX Programmatically in .NET {#section2}

You can convert DWG to FBX format with only a few lines of code. Please follow the steps below to perform the conversion:

1.  Load the input file using an object of the [Image][9] class.
2.  Initialize an instance of [FbxOptions][10] class.
3.  Finally, save the generated FBX file.

The code snippet below demonstrates how to convert a DWG file to an FBX format programmatically in C#:



## Explore More Features

The [documentation][11] section covers several features to work with CAD files. It includes different file conversions in addition to the code snippets. You can also explore different properties and classes by visiting the [API References][12].

## Get Free Temporary License

You can evaluate the API in its full capacity and without evaluation watermark by requesting a [free temporary license][13].

## Conclusion

In this article, you have learned how to convert a DWG file to FBX format programmatically in C#. The conversion process is optimized to consume minimal CPU resources and memory consumption. However, if you face any problems then feel free to reach out to us at the [forum][14].
