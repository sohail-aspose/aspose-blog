**[![ComponentSource Top 10 Publisher award][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/05/CS-Award-Top-10-Publisher-2011-12-Medium.gif)USA, Texas - May 3, 2012** - ComponentsSource is a leading online software vendor who offers products from over 250 vendors to over 125,000 customers. Every year, they put together a list of the best selling companies and products that they work with. There are two categories: [Bestselling Publisher Awards][2], and [Bestselling Product Awards][3]. Aspose placed in both categories and collected a total of six awards.

We are particularly proud to find ourselves in the top ten of the Best Selling Publisher Award. Since this award is based on our sales through ComponentSource, it is unbiased proof of how popular our products are. Our customers are voting with their pockets and there is no better endorsement. We want to thank all of our customers for their confidence in us and look forward to supporting them throughout 2012-2013.

In the Bestselling Product Awards, Top 10 Product Awards, [Aspose.Total for .NET][4] placed 8th. Aspose.Total is Aspose's flag-ship product and brings together all our components into one complete and competitive package. It's up seven places from last year.

The Top 50 Product Award saw [Aspose.Words for .NET][5] in 26th place and [Aspose.Cells for .NET][6] in 45th place.

In the Top 100 Product Awards, [Aspose.Total for Java][7] appeared in 68th place and [Aspose.Words for Java][8] in 77th. We're delighted to see our Java products enter the lists and wish them well for the year to come.
