[Aspose.Cells for .NET][1] 8.0.1 has been released. This new release supports a number of new features and enhancements.  It also includes over 30 new fixes and improvements. Moreover, we have fixed some bugs in the Grid suite provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET and improved the performance of the web-based grid control to load and manipulate bigger Microsoft Excel files.

## Set Pixel Format for the Rendered Image

Aspose.Cells allows you to set the pixel format for a rendered image. You may specify your desired pixel format when rendering worksheet to image format. By default, Aspose.Cells uses 32 bits per pixel, you may set your desired pixel format (bit depth) using the respective options provided by Aspose.Cells for the rendered image.

## Optimize Memory for the Existing Sheets

Now you can also change the memory settings of the existing sheets in a workbook. While building a workbook with large cells data set, you may utilize the options provided by Aspose.Cells which can be adopted to cope with the memory issues. Aspose.Cells provides the MemorySetting.MemoryPreference option that you may also set for the Aspose.Cells.Cells object which will optimize memory usage for the cells data to decrease the overall memory cost to certain extent. Please see the document on Optimizing Memory Usage while Working with Big Files.

## Fixes and Other Enhancements

In the new version, we have fixed a few exceptions in reading and writing Microsoft Excel file formats and converting Excel files to PDF format.

In this release, several important issues have been addressed. For example, issues around reading and writing Microsoft Excel file formats, Smart Markers, applying style and formatting, rendering and manipulating pivot tables, rendering images from Excel worksheets, reading and writing HTML files, rendering and manipulating Charts and shapes, rendering images files from charts, deleting columns and exporting Excel workbooks to PDF format have been resolved. A few enhancements have also made to Aspose.Cells for .NET's formula calculation engine to improve its performance when calculating formulas.
