Hot fix contains:  

*   New: Support for PowerPoint 2007 PPT (not PPTX) format.
*   New: Optimization of presentations created by PowerPoint 2007 by size. PP2007 creates ppt files and doubles all information in 2 formats (normal ppt and embedded xml) so ppt files have large size if compare it with ppt created with PP2000 - 2003. Aspose.Slides delete all unnecessary xml information and can reduce file size up to 3 times.
