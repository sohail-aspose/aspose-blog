We've created a new release of the Aspose for Java comparison to Apache POI HSLF and XSLF. The new release, [Missing Features of Apache POI HSLF and XSLF in Aspose][1], shows a number of Aspose.Slides features missing in Apache POI SL (HSLF + XSLF) for dealing with Microsoft PowerPoint and OpenOffice Presentations.

The source code of these examples is freely hosted on popular social coding sites like [CodePlex][2], [GitHub][3], [Bitbucket][4] and [SourceForge][5].

This release contains a few new examples of features that are only available in Aspose APIs and not in Apache POI API.
