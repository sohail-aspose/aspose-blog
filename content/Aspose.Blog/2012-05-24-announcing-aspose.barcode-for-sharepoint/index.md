**[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/04/aspose.barcode-logo2.jpg)Sydney, Australia - May 22, 2012 -** Aspose.BarCode lets software developers work with barcodes in their own applications and add barcodes to documents. The first product in the product family was [Aspose.BarCode for .NET][2], released in 2005. Since then, Aspose has added barcode features to the other platforms they support with [Aspose.BarCode for Java][3], [SQL Server Reporting Services][4] and [JasperReports][5]. Today, they release [Aspose.BarCode for SharePoint][6].

## Add Barcodes to  SharePoint Lists

Aspose.BarCode for SharePoint is an easy to install component that extends the existing SharePoint field set by adding a barcode field. This means that users can generate barcodes in SharePoint lists. The field takes two variables:

*   barcode type - the specific symbology. Over 40 are supported.
*   barcode text - the value that the barcode encodes.

Adding barcodes to your lists like this lets you keep track of tasks and incorporate document management into your workflow.

Aspose.BarCode for SharePoint supports SharePoint Foundation 2010 and SharePoint Server 2010.
