## C# API for Converting Shapefile to GeoJSON and Vice Versa {#CSharp-API-for-Converting-Shapefile-to-GeoJSON-and-Vice-Versa}

[Aspose.GIS for .NET][6] API allows you to render maps and create, read, and convert geographic data without additional software. Furthermore, the API allows you to convert Shapefile to GeoJSON and vice versa. You can either install the API through [NuGet][7] or download it directly from the [Downloads][8] section.

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.GIS
```

## Convert Shapefile to GeoJSON using C# {#Convert-Shapefile-to-GeoJSON-using-CSharp}

The following is the step to convert Shapefile to GeoJSON.

*   Use the [VectorLayer.Convert(string sourcePath, FileDriver sourceDriver, string destinationPath, FileDriver destinationDriver)][9] method to convert the Shapefile to GeoJSON.

The following sample code shows how to convert a Shapefile to GeoJSON using C#.
