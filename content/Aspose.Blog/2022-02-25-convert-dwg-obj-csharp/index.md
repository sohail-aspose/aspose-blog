[DWG][1] files are used to create technical drawings and blueprints containing two or three-dimensional vector graphics. Accordingly, you may need to render such drawings in 3D modeling applications for visualizing or manipulating the designs. You can convert the DWG file to a 3D Object file in [OBJ][2] format. This article covers how to convert a DWG drawing to an OBJ file programmatically in C#.
