New version of Aspose.Network v5.1 was released recently which fixed some issues related to downloading complex messages (with attachments and Html formatting) from Pop3 and Imap mail servers. Besides these there were also some issues in loading eml/msg files due to very large file size, MIME compatibility etc which are solved in this release.
