Aspose.Pdf pays attention to creating PDF files. We will create a new visual component pdf viewer in Aspose.Pdf.Kit. The pdf viewer component can be embedded to third party software to view and print PDF files. It has almost all Adobe Reader's functions. On the same way, it will provide APIs to achieve the same functions. We will develop both .NET and Java version of the pdf viewer. The first version of this component includes the following features:

1.  view PDF file in visual mode embedded to other application;

2.  zoom the PDF page;

3.  print the PDF file, including: print all pages, a special page and set print attributes(for example, print sheet , page shrink and expand);

We hope the Java version be available at middle August and the C# version be available at late August.
