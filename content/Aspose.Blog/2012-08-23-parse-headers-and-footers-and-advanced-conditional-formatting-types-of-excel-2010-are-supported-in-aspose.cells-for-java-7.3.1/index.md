We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Cells for Java 7.3.1][1]. In this release, you can parse headers and footers to get strings for different sections. We have also made some valuable enhancements regarding Microsoft Excel 2007/2010's advanced conditional formatting file formats types that were not supported in the product. Moreover, Microsoft Excel 2010's advanced data validation is now supported. We have also supported data filters in Pivot Tables. We have made several enhancements regarding redundant temporary files that were created for Excel to PDF feature.

We have added support for a new option: “Aspose.Cells.Disable=SunFontManager” to avoid any possible JVM crash.  The auto-shapes rendering in the output HTML is further enhanced. We have fixed some bugs and handled exceptions regarding Excel to PDF feature in the latest release. The formula calculation engine has also been improved.
