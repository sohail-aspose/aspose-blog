We are very excited to announce that this coming month [Aspose.Word][1] is going to be featured in [PC Plus magazine][2]. PC Plus will offer a fully functional, early version of the product (1.7) and will also offer an editorial that explains what all the component has to offer. [Aspose.Word][3] is a very powerful, Word document management componentÂ that has quickly gained acceptance in the .NET community. If you have not had an opportunity to review the [Aspose.Word][4] package, we encourage you to do so and see how that it can work for you!
