## New Features

We have introduced support for generating a password-protected PDF. For more details about how this feature works, read this article in our documentation.

In the past, many of our customers have reported issues with how to tell whether the Aspose.Slides license is applied properly in their application. To help them, we have introduced support for verifying if the license is properly applied and even resetting it. To find out more about this new feature, read about how to set a license.

We have also introduced support for using custom fonts without installing them from a predefined location. For more details about this feature, please read about custom fonts.
