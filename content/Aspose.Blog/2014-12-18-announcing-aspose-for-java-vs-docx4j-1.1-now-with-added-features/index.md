[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/06/aspose_words-for-java.png)[![][2]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/08/docx4j.png)We've created a new release of the Aspose for Java comparison to Docx4j. The new release, [Missing Features of Docx4j in Aspose 1.1][3], shows a number of Aspose.Words features missing in Docx4j.

The source code of these examples is freely hosted on popular social coding sites like [CodePlex][4], [GitHub][5], [Bitbucket][6] and [SourceForge][7].

This release contains a few new examples of features that are only available in Aspose APIs and not in Docx4j API of Project Docx4j and related tools.

## What's New

*   [Check Format Compatibility][8].
*   [Load Text File][9].
*   [Working with Digital Signatures][10].
*   [Specify Default Fonts][11].
*   [Autofit Setting to Tables][12].

## Existing Samples

*   [Clone Documents][13].
*   [Joining Tables in Document][14].
*   [Mail Merge from XML Data Source][15].
*   [Moving the Cursor in Document][16].
*   [Protect Documents][17].

There is much more yet to come and many more examples with documentation are available at Aspose Docs. Keep visiting us.
