![Aspose.Cells icon][1]

We have released the Aspose.Cells for .NET v7.0.1. In this version, we have made some enhancements regarding formatting cells. You can now add and delete rows in MS Excel Tables/List Objects. The desktop grid control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET, now, provides formula bar control same as MS Excel.

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
