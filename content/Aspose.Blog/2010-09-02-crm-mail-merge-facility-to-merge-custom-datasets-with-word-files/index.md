## About Comgem



{{< figure align=center src="images/Screenshot-2020-04-21-at-2.41.56-AM.png" alt="comgem company logo">}}


[Comgem][1] is a web development company and application service provider that delivers a range of application services including Email Marketing, eCommerce and a Customer Relationship Management system.

## Problem

As part of our CRM, we integrated a mail merge facility that allowed users to merge custom datasets with Microsoft Word documents. With our previous supplier, we were encountering strange behavior when trying to create different text on each label rather than batch labels.

Furthermore, when running large mail merges (_i.e. a few thousand records_), We were also encountering server errors. Since our customer databases were expanding, this obviously presented an issue and we were required to identify an alternative solution.

## Solution

After performing a search for mail merge functionality, we identified [Aspose.Words for .NET][2] was a real contender. After downloading and using the [trial version][3], we were surprised not only by the [quick support][4] (_provided freely_) but also by the [capabilities of the product][5]. It was quick and extremely easy to integrate into our codebase and most importantly, it delivered the results that we expected. Therefore we got 100% confidence in rolling out this functionality to our customers and knew that we have an extremely scalable and stable mail merge functionality.

## Experience

### **Finding a Solution**

We did evaluate other products, but the features offered by [Aspose.Words for .NET][6] attracted us along with the [fantastic support][7].

### **Implementation**

The implementation was effortless and only took four hours, in comparison to days trying to identify issues with the previous supplier. When buying in components, you always assume that the components are working and this naturally makes you believe the issue is with your code. With [Aspose.Words for .NET][8], it worked the first time and has worked every time.

### **Outcome**

We now have a working mail merge facility, that has exceeded our requirements and provides enhanced performance as well as feature-rich out of the box capabilities.

## Next Steps

We definitely recommend switching to [Aspose.Words for .NET][9]. Albeit, we were extremely apprehensive in using this component, but with their [support][10] behind, you need to be sure the transition will be a smooth and painless process.

## Summary

We have always heard good things about [Aspose][11] and these recommendations have been met. Even though they are slightly more expensive than other companies, this additional cost is saved when comparing it with the time to implement and their proactive support mechanisms.
