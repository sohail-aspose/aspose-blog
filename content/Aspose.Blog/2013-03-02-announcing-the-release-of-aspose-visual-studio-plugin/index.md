We are happy to announce the release of Aspose Visual Studio Plugin 1.0.0. This plugin isÂ for those busy developers who want to try out [Aspose .NET components][1] quickly without leaving their Visual Studio IDE. It is your own playground for quickly learning and playing with Aspose .NET components: it reduces the learning curve. The Aspose Visual Studio plugin is a wizard which allows you to create new Aspose projects. Download it from [Codeplex][2].

The plugin works in two steps:

**1\. Select Aspose .NET components**

In the first step, select Aspose components. The first screen helps you select the components you want to try. Selected components are automatically downloaded and referenced in projects. Release notes are displayed when a new version is released. With this plugin, you never need to check for new releases of Aspose components because whenever a new release is published, you are notified while creating project and you can also view release notes.

In the second step, the plugin provides you with a list of downloaded components. Once a component is selected all its available samples are populated in a tree for easy navigation. Product Samples are displayed in a tree format that helps you to browse and use any sample code quickly. Once you finish selecting a sample, the plugin creates a project and opens it in your active workspace.
