**New Features**

*   List styles are fully supported during load, save and copy between DOC files.Â Note there is still no rich public API to deal with list formatting, but this feature is a prerequisite step towards it.
*   Added CompositeNode.GetChildNodes that returns either "live" or "dead" collection of nodes. Before that all returned collections were live.
*   Added a bit more code examples to the API Reference.

**Fixes**

*   Aspose.Words.Viewer Beta throws an exception when you attempt to print.
*   Fixed handling of the "rowspan" attribute during HTML import.
