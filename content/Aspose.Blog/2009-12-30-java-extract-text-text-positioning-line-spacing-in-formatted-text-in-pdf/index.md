Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java 2.5.0 is released. In this latest version, we have added a new feature to extract text from a copy protected file. We have also introduced two new methods named getPageXOffset and getPageYOffset for better stamping calculation. The text positioning calculation is also enhanced for precise text positioning. Some other text related improvements have been made in the latest version.
