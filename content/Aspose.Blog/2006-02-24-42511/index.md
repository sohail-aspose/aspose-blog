Aspose Sales have started actively seeking out new reselling partners worldwide. In the past week, we have added 14 new resellers. We have added many new countries to our list. Here are our new countries: Slovakia, India, Israel, Italy, and Thailand. We also have additions to these countries: Netherlands, Brazil, Hong Kong, Germany, Poland, United Kingdom, and Singapore. We are so excited about our new resellers and hope that we can provide more convenience for our worldwide customers. You can view our [Reseller List][1] to see our resellers listed by country.

If you need any assistance with either becoming a reseller or finding a local reseller, please email [sales][2]. We are happy to help. Have a great weekend.
