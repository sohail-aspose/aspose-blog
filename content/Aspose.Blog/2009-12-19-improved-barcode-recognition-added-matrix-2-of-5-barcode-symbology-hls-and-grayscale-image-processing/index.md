We have recently released Aspose.BarCode for .NET v3.1.0. This is a major release that includes new features and some bug fixes.  
  
We added support of Matrix 2 of 5 (2/5 Matrix) symbology in this release. It supports both generation and recognition of Matrix 2 of 5 barcodes.  
  
To improve the process of recognition, we added support of Median Smoothing, HLS and Grayscale image processing.
