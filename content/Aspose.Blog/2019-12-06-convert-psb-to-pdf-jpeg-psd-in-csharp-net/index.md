[Aspose.PSD][1] now supports the [PSB][2] file format. The PSB (**P**hoto**s**hopÂ **B**ig file) is an Adobe Photoshop Large Document file. Only a few users of Adobe Photoshop know about the existence of the PSB file format but all are familiar with the [PSD][3] file format. The PSB format is similar to PSD format except that PSB supports larger files, both in image dimension and overall size.

The PSD file format is limited to 30K x 30K pixels, which is the main file format used by Adobe Photoshop. PSBs, on the other hand, supports documents up to 300K pixels in any dimension, which is plenty even for graphics designers who often need to work with ultra-high resolutions. A PSB file supports layers, effects, filters, and all other features of Adobe Photoshop. It is also possible to save HDR images with the PSB file format.

## How to Convert a PSB File in C#

Using [Aspose.PSD][4] you can convert existing PSB files directly into [PSD][5], [PDF][6], [JPEG][7] and several other formats without any loss of quality. In this article, we will demonstrate how you can convert PSB files to other formats.
