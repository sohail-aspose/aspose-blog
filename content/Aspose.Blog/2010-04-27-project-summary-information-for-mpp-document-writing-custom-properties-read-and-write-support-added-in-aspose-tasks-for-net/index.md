A number of customers have been looking for MPP write support and we are moving ahead in this regard. Aspose.Tasks for .NET 2.8.0 has introduced reading an existing MPP file, updating project summary information and then writing updated project in original MPP file format in the licensed version. We have also added features of reading and writing custom properties of an MPP document. In addition, a number of bugs have been fixed.
