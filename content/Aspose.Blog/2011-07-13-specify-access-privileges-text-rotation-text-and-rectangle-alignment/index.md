![Aspose.Pdf icon][1]

We are very much excited to announce the release of another version of Aspose.Pdf for JasperReports. This new version provides some new exciting features including specification of access privileges over resultant PDF (setting user and owner password, restrict printing, restrict copying of dataÂ and much more). We have also added the support for a Rotation parameter for TextElement, so you can either use Left or Right value. This new version gives you the leverage to specify text and rectangle alignment information and they are properly honored during PDF generation. Nevertheless, some other miscellaneous issues are also fixed.

Please get the chance to download and try using the latest release version of [Aspose.Pdf for JasperReports 1.1.0][2].
