Aspose.Cells for .NET v7.1.1 has been released. This release includes support for tracing precedents and dependents. We also supported new HTML table attributes (for example, TH, ROWSPAN, etc.) for HTML-to-Excel conversion. Moreover, you can now ignore hidden columns when using the auto-fit column(s) feature.Â We have enhanced the formula calculation engine and sorted out a few formulas, most notably, VLOOKUP, OFFSET, ADDRESS, COUNTBLANK, IF and NETWORKDAYS. We have also improved the [Excel-to-PDF][2] conversion feature. Moreover, we fixed a few issues in the web-based and desktop based Grid controls provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET.

That's not all: there are some other fixes and enhancements too.
