[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for .NET 14.10.0. This is one of maintenance releases where we have included some new features as well.

## New Features

We have introduced support for WordArt rendering in this new API. Now, the generated slide thumbnails, exported PDF, Tiff and SVG will render WordArt shapes properly if they are added in presentation slides. We have also introduced the support for generating the HTML file for independent presentation slides as well in this release. Now, one can generate the HTML file per slide by following the documentation link, Converting individual Slide to HTML in a Presentation. We have also introduced support for adding the layout slides in a presentation if the desired layout type is missing in layout slides collection of used master slide. More details about this feature are available in the article [Adding Layout Slides to Presentation][2].

## Resolved Issues

We have improved the presentation rendering support and have resolved certain rendering issues incurring during generation of slide thumbnails, exported PDF, Tiff, SVG and XPS files. The issues include improper text, missing background, blank slides, missing WordArt, improper SmartArt and different charts elements rendering.

We have rectified issues that appeared when accessing, saving and rendering presentation to PDF, HTML or slide thumbnails, which resulted in different exceptions like NullReference, ArgumentException, PptxReadException, ObjectReferenceException,and IndexOutOfRange in previous releases.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Refer to the article Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for .NET 14.10.0 for further reference.
