## Create Repeating Section Content Controls in Word Document

**TIP**

The repeating section content control allows repeating the content contained within it. Using Aspose.Words for Android via Java, the structured document tag nodes of the repeating section and repeating section item types can be created and for this purpose, [SdtType enumeration type][4] provides REPEATING\_SECTION\_ITEM member. The following code example demonstrates how to [Bind a Repeating Section Content Control in Word Document to a Table][5].

## LINQ Reporting using XML, JSON, and CSV Data Sources

The LINQ Reporting engine of 'Aspose.Words for Android via Java' now enables you to reference business objects of your application in report templates. We have added XmlDataSource, JsonDataSource, and CsvDataSource classes in this release to use XML, JSON, and CSV as data sources to generate reports using LINQ Reporting.

'Aspose.Words for Android via Java' API now provides a method CustomDocumentProperties.addLinkToContent(String, String) to create a new 'linked to content' custom document property which returns the newly created property object or null if the link source is invalid. The following code example demonstrates how to [Configure the Link to a Content Custom Property][9].
