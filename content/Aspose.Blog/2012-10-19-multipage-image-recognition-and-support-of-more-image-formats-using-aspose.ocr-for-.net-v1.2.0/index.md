[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/10/imgLogoOCR128x128.png)Aspose.OCR for .NET 1.2.0 has been released. We are pleased to announce that support of more image formats is included in this release:  JPG, JPEG, PNG and GIF. This expands the scope of the Aspose.OCR API. This release supports recognition of multipage TIFF image with the introduction of a new property for OcrEngin-ProcessAllPages.  This release also supports recognition of text in form fields, that is, tables. The text recognition accuracy is above 90% and is 100% in some cases with 32pt +/- 20% sizes of the supported font families.

In addition to new features and enhancements, the release includes a few bugs fixes as well.
