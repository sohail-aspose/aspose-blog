Aspose has made changes to its existing NetBeans plugin for **NetBeans IDE 7.4 and onwards** to integrate it smoothly in the native flow of project and file creation. Because of this seamless integration with NetBeans IDE, the Aspose team is now included on the [NetBeans Partner page][1].

## How to Install Aspose NetBeans Plugin

Aspose Project Wizard plugin can be easily installed from the Available Plugin tab in the Plugin dialog. (To open it, select **Plugins** from the **Tools** menu in NetBeans).

This adds the **Aspose Application** and **Aspose Example** options to NetBeans. Below are the steps for how these options can be used to quickly use Aspose components in any Aspose application.

## Aspose Application

The desired [Aspose components][2] can be selected for inclusion into your Java application when creating a new project.

1.  Select **New Project**.
2.  Select **Aspose Application** in the **Java** category.
3.  Click **Next**.

1.  Provide a **Project Name** and **Location** just like when creating any Java application.

1.  Select Aspose Components from the list and click **Finish**.  
    This downloads the selected libraries.

An Aspose project is created and the downloaded Aspose JARs are added to the classpath.

4.  Select Aspose Java components from the lists.  
    The panel below shows an example of selected components in a tree format.
5.  Expand the tree to select an example and click **Finish**. This adds Java and other required data files to the Aspose application.
6.  Review the example code, compile, and run.
