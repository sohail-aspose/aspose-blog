My name is Roman Korchagin and I lead the Aspose Auckland Development Team. We are responsible for [Aspose.Word][1], [Aspose.Chart][2], [Aspose.Spell][3] and [Aspose.Recurrence][4] (what is soon to become Aspose.iCalendar).  

I'm heavily involved in development and support of the products and you will see it's mostly me who is replying in the Support Forums for questions about these products. At the moment I have two other brilliant developers on my team. While I'm based in Auckland, New Zealand, they are based in Vladivostok, Russia.  

My work on the components is very exciting and important to me and I will probably blog mostly about what we are working on. Hopefully, this could be interesting and helpful to anyone who is already using or evaluating Aspose products as well as for any .NET developer as the blogs will highlight our best efforts, practices and diligence we put into the products.
