[![Aspose.Cells logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/05/aspose.cells-logo2.jpg)Aspose.Cells for .NET 7.4.0 has been released. This month’s release includes an enhancement for advanced conditional formatting when converting worksheet to image files. We have also made an enhancement to the Microsoft Excel ruler which is not displayed when setting Page Layout view. We have improved the performance of Excel to PDF rendering, sometimes the process hanged a bit for certain Excel files.

In this release, several important issues have been addressed. For example, issues around rendering spreadsheets (XLS, XLSX etc.), protecting sheets, rendering PivotTables, encrypting files and exporting to PDF have been resolved. Issues pertaining to the formula calculation engine have also been fixed.

We have made a few enhancements in Aspose.Cells for .NET's web based Grid control. For example, GridWeb can now read list data validations in the template file and you can write code for drawing object and shape Click events. We also made enhancements and fixes so that the GridWeb control works smoothly with browser types other than Internet Explorer types (for example, Google Chrome, FireFox, and Safari) when performing insert and edit operations. We have also fixed an issue in the desktop based Grid control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET to improve moving and navigating to cells using the keyboard.
