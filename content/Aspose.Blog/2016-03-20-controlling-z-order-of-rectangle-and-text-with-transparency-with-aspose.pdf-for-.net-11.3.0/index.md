As a part of our continuous improvement process, a new release of [Aspose.PDF for .NET 11.3.0][1] has been published with some new features. Among these new features, we also have fixed major issues regarding PDF to PDF/A conversion, PDF to TIFF, ePUB to PDF, HTML to PDF, PDF to JPEG and general performance improvements.

## Controlling Z-Order of Rectangle in PDF

Aspose.PDF for .NET supports the feature to add graph objects (for example graph, line, rectangle etc.) to PDF documents. When adding more than one instance of same object inside PDF file, we can control their rendering by specifying the Z-Order. Z-Order is also used when we need to render objects on top of each other.

## Add Transparent Text in PDF

A PDF file contains Image, Text, Graph, attachment, Annotations objects and while creating TextFragment, you can set foreground, background-color information as well as text formatting. Aspose.PDF for .NET supports the feature to add text with the Alpha color channel.
