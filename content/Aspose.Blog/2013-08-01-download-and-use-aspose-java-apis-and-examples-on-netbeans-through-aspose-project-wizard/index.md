Aspose keeps putting effort into enriching the user experience for their file format APIs,Â  available for various development platforms including Java. NetBeans is one of the famous IDEs widely in use by Java developers to manage Java projects when developing components or applications. To allow them to download and use multiple Aspose Java APIs and examples through a single click in a NetBeans project, we've introduced Aspose Project Wizard for NetBeans. This wizard is [available for download][1] from the NetBeans Plugin directory.

## Advantages of using Aspose Project Wizard

Some advantages of using Aspose Project Wizard are:

*   Create NetBeans project through a 'simple to use' wizard.
