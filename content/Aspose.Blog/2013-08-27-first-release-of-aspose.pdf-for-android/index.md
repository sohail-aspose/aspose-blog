Over the years, the Aspose.Pdf product family has been very successful providing customers with PDF files creation from scratch as well manipulating existing PDF files. We have components for .NET, Java, SQL Reporting Services, SharePoint services, Cloud API’s and Jasper Reports. Seeing the popularity and growth of applications for mobile platforms, we created a new component specific to the Android platform.

## Aspose.Pdf for Android

We are very much excited to announce the release of Aspose.Pdf for Android which provides the capability to create as well as manipulate PDF files on Android. This component is built on top of our award winning product Aspose.Pdf for Java, and inherits all the features and capabilities from that version. The component empowers Android developers to deal with PDF documents in their applications without using any PDF file editor.

Like other members of the Aspose.Pdf product family, Aspose.Pdf for Android allows developers to create AcroForms from scratch and also manage form fields in existing PDF documents. Without spending tremendous amount of time or effort, this component enables you to create PDF documents both from API and XML templates. You can also easily insert or manipulate bookmarks, annotations, tables, images and many more components in PDF documents. It also supports concatenating, optimizating, and compressing PDF documents.
