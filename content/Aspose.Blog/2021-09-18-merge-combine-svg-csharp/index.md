1.  Initialize SVG documents from files to merge images.
2.  Create an instance of SvgRenderer class.
3.  Specify different properties using PdfRenderingOptions object.
4.  Create an instance of PdfDevice class.
5.  Merge the SVG image files to a PDF document.

The following code shows how to merge or combine SVG images to a PDF document with C#:
