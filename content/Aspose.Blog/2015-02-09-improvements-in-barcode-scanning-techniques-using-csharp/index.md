We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.BarCode for .NET][1] 6.8.0. This new release deals with the improvements in barcode decoding techniques. Our development team works hard to gradually improve barcode readings. However, there are many factors, that are involved in recognition failure, incorrect readings or multiple readings of a single barcode. When we talk about improving barcode scanning, it means to cater all sub-areas. These sub-areas deserve everyone's attention.

The major areas include the quality of the barcode image. In this regard, we have already offered a few filters, that help to enhance barcode pictures and we also recommend our users to only put barcodes on the picture. Other items or natural scenes can mess gray scaling process. Similarly, the best barcode orientation is horizontal and the worst orientation is diagonal 45 or 225 degrees.

This release comprises a number of key fixes that help us improve accuracy, performance and reading capabilities.
