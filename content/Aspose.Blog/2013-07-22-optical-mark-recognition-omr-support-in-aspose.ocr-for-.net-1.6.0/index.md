We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.OCR for .NET 1.6.0. In this release, we have introduced the exciting feature of optical mark recognition to Aspose.OCR for .NET API. The Aspose.OMR namespace can be used to recognize different marked elements from a scanned image. Recognition is processed based on a template that contains graphical mapping of the elements to be recognized from the scanned images. Programmers can use Aspose.OMR namespace to programmatically load templates and images, and extract data based on these.

Aspose.OMR namespace provides the capability to extract data from a scanned image for the following commonly used element types:

1.  Checkboxes
2.  Choice boxes
3.  Grid

Aspose.OCR for .NET API also comes with the OMR Template Editor. The OMR Template Editor is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for designing templates graphically with the required elements. The template editor:

*   Enables users to quickly design templates graphically.
*   Provides facility to add elements, edit and delete elements from the template.
*   Facilitates users to superimpose scanned images over template design and view the extracted data graphically.
