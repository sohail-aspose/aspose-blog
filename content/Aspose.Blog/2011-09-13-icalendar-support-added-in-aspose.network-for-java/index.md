![Aspose.Network icon][1]

We are pleased to announce the release of a new version of Aspose.Network for Java 2.3. In this version, we added the iCalendar component. iCalendar is already part of Aspose.Network for .NET, now you can generate dates according to the specified recurrence pattern in Java.

Below is an example to generate dates based on a recurrence pattern:

String pattern = "DTSTART:19970902T090000\\n" +  
"RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;UNTIL=19971007T000000Z;WKST=SU;BYDAY=SU,MO";  
RecurrencePattern recPattern = new RecurrencePattern(pattern);  
  
// Get all the dates generated by this rule  
DateCollection dateColl = recPattern.generateOccurrences();

We also added support for creating, loading, editing and saving appointments in ICS format.
