## About Arcoba



{{< figure align=center src="images/logo_ombra.png" alt="Arcoba Company logo">}}


[Arcoba][1] is a small company specialized in financial software. We provide analysis and development of software solutions, advanced and proactive customer support, data migration, and constant updates. Arcoba also deals directly with the analysis, development, and design of software solutions aimed at satisfying the operational/functional needs of its customers.

## Problem

Our goal and our need were to develop a feature that allowed users to convert a text (_.html_) generated by web-based JavaScript WYSIWYG HTML editor (TinyMCE) in word (both .doc and .docx) and pdf format. We needed to realize this as a .NET service, working under both Linux (_mono_) and Windows environment.

## Experience

We started to look for software components (_possibly free - our budget was quite low_) to use for our development.

We tried many components, including:

*   Wkhtmltopdf (html to pdf – free)
*   Essentialobjects (html to pdf - third party)
*   Nreco (html to pdf – free)
*   Docx4j (html do docx – free)
*   Gembox (html to docx - third party)
*   Html to OpenXML (.docx to html - free on codeplex)
*   OpenXML (.docx to html – free)
*   DocX (.docx to html - free on codeplex)

and, after some (_not really exciting_) experimentation, we chose to use Wkhtmltopdf, available for both Windows and Linux and Docx4j (java) for our project.

Unfortunately, both of these components were not able to replicate faithfully the content of the HTML file, so we had to dynamically make changes to the HTML content in order to have acceptable results. Even with this approach, it was impossible to be sure about the quality of the results! (_the HTML files included many combinations of tags which cannot be managed correctly_).

Since we had a really short time, so we presented the developed solution to our customers, who became very disappointed due to the following reasons:

*   The font style in some cases suffered changes
*   Pagination and text disposition on the page were not always fully respected
*   Images were not aligned and sized properly
*   The overall conversion performance was not really exciting

Practically, only a few customers were able to use the new feature and it only worked in very simple conversions.

## Solution

We did not give up, so we decided to try [Aspose.Words for .NET][2] component, which we did not consider in the first place, because of the relatively high prices.

Well… the results were exciting:

*   Excellent conversion quality (_absolutely no problem with page style and pagination itself_)
*   Use of a single component to perform conversions between HTML, Word or PDF
*   Significantly improved conversion performance
*   No more need to develop dynamic changes to the content of the HTML file
*   It works really well in both Windows and Linux environment
*   And finally: faithful and identical output from the [HTML conversion to MS Word document][3] and [HTML conversion to PDF format][4]

It was very easy to use [Aspose.Words for .NET][5] to load and manipulate HTML files and for the conversion process.

## Develop

We used a [free trial][6] to try and test [Aspose.Words for .NET][7] in our application. We also contacted [Aspose Technical support][8] (_free for all_) to ask help about some conversion behaviours.

## Next Steps

In future, we will implement a feature to [dynamically generate excel documents][9] and, surely after this experience, we will directly use [Aspose.Cells for .NET][10]. It will help us in saving time and we hope that the results would be excellent.

## Summary

[Aspose.Words for .NET][11] is a powerful component, very easy to integrate and to use. We recommend [Aspose][12] not only for its products but also for its **open-source feel** approach (_frequent releases, features prioritized according to your requests, [free support for anyone][13]_).
