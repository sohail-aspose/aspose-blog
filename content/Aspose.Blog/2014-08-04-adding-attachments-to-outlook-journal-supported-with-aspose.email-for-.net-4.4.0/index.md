[![][1]](http://www.aspose.com/.net/email-component.aspx)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Email for .NET 4.4.0. This month’s release includes a number of enhancements to existing API features which further enrich the API functionality. This latest version also includes a number of bug fixes that improve the overall API performance. You can download this latest version from the [product download][2] page.

## Adding Attachments to Outlook Journal Items

The Aspose.Email API already supports creating Microsoft Outlook journal items and adding these to PST files. Outlook allows users to add attachments to journal items and save them as MSG files. This feature was not supported by Aspose.Email previously. We are glad to share that this month’s release provides Aspose.Email API users with the capability to add attachments to a journal item and save it to Outlook MSG format.

## Searching PST for Messages by Message ID

Searching PST for message items is already supported by the Aspose.Email API. This feature allows developers to search for a PST based on defined criteria such as message class and importance, presence of attachments, message size and unread messages, and folders with specific subfolders name. This month’s release further enhances the PST search functionality by allowing searching PST for messages using message ID. This feature is helpful in building email archiving applications where each message is referenced by ID.

## Bug Fixes and Other Improvements

As usual, this month’s release also includes a number of bug fixes that further improves the overall API functionality. These include, but are not limited to:

*   Encoding issues during conversion of email messages between various formats.
*   Exceptions related to email clients functionality.
*   Issues related to API hanging while loading specific MSG types.
*   EML to MHTML conversion issues.
