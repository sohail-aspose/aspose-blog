[![Aspose.Cells for SharePoint logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/aspose-Cells-for-SharePoint_100.png)We are happy to announce Aspose.Cells for SharePoint 3.0.2. In this release, we have provided enhanced support for the searching in a document feature. We have also included some other enhancements and fixes: we have fixed an issue regarding setting license using **Aspose.Total.SharePoint.License.wsp**, and we have fixed an issue regarding an interface in SharePoint. We've also fixed an issue that occurred when using the search feature in the **Action** menu(s) at the document root folder in Aspose.Cells for SharePoint on SharePoint 2007.
