## Reconnecting with our customers

As part of our ongoing celebration of our 10th birthday, we've been talking to some of our very first customers about their experiences of the software industry (and our tools) over the last decade. The first of our customers that we reconnected with was Rob Wilson, Director at Edupoint Educational Systems. [Edupoint][1] develops enterprise-level software to support U.S. school districts. The software manages everything from back-office activities and state reporting, to front-end portals for parents and students. We're delighted that they use our products in their business amd look forward to working with them over the next 10 years.

Thank you for reading,  
John Owens, Aspose Scotland Team Leader
