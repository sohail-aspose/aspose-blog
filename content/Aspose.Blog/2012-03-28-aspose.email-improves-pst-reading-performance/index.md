[![Aspose.Email for .NET][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/02/aspose.email-logo120.jpg)

We have just released Aspose.Email for .NET 1.6. In this version we have introduced the EnumerateMessageObjects and EnumerateMapiMessages methods to the FolderInfo class to improve the PST reading performance. These methods allow you to quickly iterate over the messages present in any PST folder and significantly reduce the execution time for such processes. With this release you can also add time zone information with an appointment request and save any message to OFT file format.
