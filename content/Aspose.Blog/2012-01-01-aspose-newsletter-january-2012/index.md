## Wishing you all a great new 2012

Welcome to 2012! December and January are months for reflection and like many other companies, we have spent some time looking back at the year that past and thinking about what we want to achieve in the year ahead. 2011 was a good year for Aspose. We released five new products. We improved our existing products in more ways that you can easily count. Our users helped us win community awards. To give back to the community, we supported user groups and conferences. Our all new Consulting services gave us some really interesting projects. We even reached 10,000 customers. In 2012, we want to keep this momentum and continue to deliver services and products that our users really need. Watch this space.

Thank you for reading.  
Danny Cooper, Aspose Texas Team Leader

## Product Spotlight – Aspose.OCR for .NET

Aspose.OCR for .NET is a character recognition component that allows developers to add OCR functionality to their ASP.NET applications. It provides a simple set of classes for controlling character recognition. [Download Aspose.OCR and start a trial][2].

## Technical Article – Applying protection to a presentation with Aspose.Slides for .NET

Aspose provides security features beyond those offered by Microsoft PowerPoint. One of the things that we let you do is lock shapes and groups in the document so that they cannot be edited. You can then distribute the presentation in the knowledge that no one can manipulate it. Read the technical article.

## Tutorial Video – Importing data from a database with Aspose.Cells for Java

Spreadsheets are great for working with and presenting data. But how do you get the data in there in the first place? Learn how to read data from a MDB file using JDBC-ODBC and import it into a worksheet using Aspose.Cells for Java. [Watch the tutorial][3].

## Migration Tip – Joining documents with Aspose.Words for .NET
