As part of the Aspose.Pdf product family, Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services successfully generates PDF files on SQL Reporting Services. It provides various configuration and parameterization options that are not supported by SQL Reporting Services' default PDF rendering feature.

## Support for SharePoint 2013

In this release, we have also fixed issues reported against earlier versions. Some of the fixes include rendering reports containing embedded images, font formatting being lost during PDF rendering, image and graph objects not being exported properly, image colors being lost and miscellaneous issues related to text rendering. We also have introduced support for dynamically adding images to reports and then rendering to PDF format.
