STL files are used in computer-aided manufacturing as these files contain 3D geometrical information. Whereas, a [USDZ][1] file is often used to create augmented-reality-based scenes. In certain use cases, you might need to convert an STL file to USDZ format. This article covers how to convert an STL file to a USDZ file programmatically in C#.

## STL to USDZ Converter – C# API Installation {#section1}

[Aspose.3D for .NET][4] API supports creating, editing, or manipulating FBX, OBJ, and many [other supported formats][5]. Simply access the API by downloading its DLL files from the [Downloads][6] pages or use the following [NuGet][7] installation command:

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.3D
```

## Convert STL to USDZ Format Programmatically in C# {#section2}

You can convert an STL file to the USDZ format by following the steps below:

1.  Load the input STL file with an instance of the [Scene][8] class
2.  Initialize an instance of the [UsdSaveOptions][9] class.
3.  Convert STL to USDZ format.

The following code sample shows how to convert an STL file to USDZ format in C#:



## Explore API Features

The API supports several other file conversions and 3D scene manipulations as discussed in different chapters in the [documentation][10] section. You may like to take a look to check other APIs supported to work with three-dimensional graphics.

## Get Free Temporary License

You may test all the features of the API in their full capacity by getting a [free temporary license][11]. It enables you to evaluate the performance of the API without any evaluation limitations.

## Conclusion

In this article, you have explored how to convert an STL file to USDZ format programmatically in C#. However, in case you need to discuss any of your requirements or queries, please write to us at the [forum][12].
