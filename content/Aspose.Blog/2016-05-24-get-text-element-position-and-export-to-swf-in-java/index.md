We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Slides for Java][1] 16.4.0. It comes with improved support for the presentation rendering, along with many bug fixes.

## New Features

We have introduced the long-awaited support of exporting presentations to SWF format. Please visit the documentation article, Converting a presentation to SWF for further reference. We have also included the support for getting the coordinates for paragraphs and portions holding text inside the presentation slide. GetRect() and GetCoordinates() methods have been added in Paragraph and Portion classes respectively. Please visit the documentation article, Getting Paragraph, and Portion coordinates in a TextFrame for further reference.

## Resolved Issues

We have improved the presentation rendering feature s and have resolved many rendering issues that earlier resulted in missing or improper images, missing charts, missing tables, improper text rendering, improper gradient effects, missing shadow effects and broken hyperlinks for exported PDF and slide thumbnails. We have also addressed the text alignment, Ole frame resizing, default zoom, protected view error messages, slide numbering getting lost and broken hyperlink issues for generated presentation as well.

The presentation access and saving issues have been rectified for many presentation decks that resulted in exceptions including PptxReadException, ArgumentException , UnSupportedFormatException and NullReferenceException in previous releases. We have also improved the slide cloning support and have resolved several incurring issues in this regard as well.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to Aspose.Slides for Java 16.4.0 Release Notes for further reference.
