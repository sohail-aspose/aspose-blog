We are happy to announce the release of a new version of Aspose.BarCode for .NET. In this major release, we added support for reading barcodes on Windows Phone 7. It currently supports most of 1D and Postal barcode symbologies. 2D barcode recognition will be added in future. Grab yourself a copy of Windows Phone Developer tools from [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=04704acf-a63a-4f97-952c-8b51b34b00ce][1] and start evaluating the barcode recognition on Windows Phone 7.

Below is a screenshot of the Windows Phone 7 demo application included with Aspose.BarCode for .NET.
