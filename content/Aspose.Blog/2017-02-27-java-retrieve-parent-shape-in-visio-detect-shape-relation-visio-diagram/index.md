We’re pleased to announce that the [new version 17.02.0 of Aspose.Diagram for Java API][1] is now live. The new version of the API has added a metered licensing mechanism which allows to track the actual usage of Aspose.Diagram API. Our clients can also use the old traditional license approach because they might not comfortable with the new usage based licensing approach. During the manipulation of Visio drawing, Aspose.Diagram API allows developers to retrieve the parent shape using sub-shape object. Developers can also detect the status of a shape, whether it is the part of any group shape or not. We're dedicated to improve the API because our aim is to give the best service and high-quality APIs. In the various cases, we give fixes and enhancements before they are available in an official release, so that we could incorporate the feedback of the client. All the regular bug fixes and enhancements are also included. We recommend our clients [use the powerful Aspose for Java APIs directly in their Maven Projects with simple configurations][2]. For details on API fixes, please visit the product Release Notes section of this new version.

## Overview of the Usage Based Metering System

Using Aspose.Diagram API, developers can make an API call to apply usage based metering system. It'll track the overall consumption in an automated way. We have plans to further enhance usage based licensing system. The recent version of Aspose.Diagram API adds a Metered class. Developers can set public and private keys to apply usage based license by calling a setMeteredKey method of the Metered class. Please check this help topic to know the implementation of metered license: [Set Public and Private Keys to Apply Metered License][3]

## Detect Shape Relation to the Group

Using Aspose.Diagram API, developers can find shape relation to the group. Shape class has integrated isInGroup method which allows developers to know whether the recent shape is the sub-shape of any group or not. It helps in manipulating shapes and apply checks on code level. This help topic shows how to verify whether the recent shape is part of any group shape: [Verify Whether the Visio Shape is in a Group of Shapes][4]

## Retrieve the Parent Shape in Visio Drawing

The recent version gives flexibility in retrieving the hierarchy of shapes in the Visio drawing. Developers were not able to get parent shape. They can now retrieve parent shape using child shape object and vice versa. This help topic shows how to retrieve the parent shape of recent sub-shape: [Retrieve the Parent Shape of a Sub-Shape  
](https://docs.aspose.com/diagram/java/working-with-visio-shape-data/#Add,Retrieve,CopyandReadVisioShapeData-RetrievetheParentShapeofaSub-Shape)  
Developers can find an improvement in the export feature because this new version of the API integrates a number of export bug fixes. Aspose.Diagram for Java is auto ported from its .NET equivalent version to give developers perfectly same features on both platforms, since this version also incorporates the bug fixes of .NET version. Please check a list of the resolved defects:

*   Fixed: VSD to PDF conversion, the background color shade of a group shape is getting changed.
*   Fixed: A blank page is generated while converting a Visio page with equations to PNG.
*   Fixed: Borders are missing while converting VSDX to PNG.
*   Fixed: Symbol disappears while converting VSDX to PNG.
*   Fixed: Symbol disappears while converting VSDX to SVG.
*   Fixed: Color of the text is different while converting VSDX to PNG.
*   Fixed: The text position is incorrect when VSD is converted to SVG format.
*   Fixed: \[VSDX to PDF\] - Error message occurred when used LeagueGothic Regular font.
