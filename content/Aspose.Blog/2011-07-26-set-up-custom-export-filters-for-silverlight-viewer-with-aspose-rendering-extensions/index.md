**Texas, USA - 26 July, 2011 -** Online reports are crucial to many businesses. A well-planned and designed report helps readers visualize data and understand patterns in it. A good report gives insight that helps businesses make the right decisions. Considering how important understanding data is it is unsurprising that there are many powerful reporting and visualization tools on the market. [Aspose creates rendering extensions for one of the most popular][1], Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS).

# Silverlight and SSRS

Microsoft Silverlight allows software engineers to create powerful interactive applications for web or mobile use. Perpetuum Software develops high-quality components and software that give businesses real advantages. They develop tools that help software engineers build complex business intelligence applications quickly. Focussing on visualisation and reporting, they offer development tools for .NET, OLAP and Silverlight. Perpetuum Software's [Silverlight Viewer for Reporting Services][2] makes it possible to view SSRS reports in Silverlight applications.

Delivering SSRS reports through Silverlight gives users business insight at their fingertips, but what happens when users want to save a report, to print it or take it away with them for analysis? SSRS offers limited options. Luckily, it is easy to export reports to any number of popular file formats with the right tools.

# Working example

To illustrate how well their and Aspose's development tools work together, Perpetuum have put together a working example of how to add custom export filters using [Aspose.Total for Reporting Services][3] to [Silverlight Viewer for Reporting Services 2008][4]. The process involves three simple steps:

1.  creating a Silverlight application,
2.  adding export options to an application with just a few lines of code to Web.Config file,
3.  and adding images for custom export filters to be displayed on the toolbar of the application.

Perpetuum's Vitaliy Korney wrote a [blog post that expands on each point][5] and links to the complete example application so that readers can try it for themselves. It's a simple but elegant solution that shows the power both of Aspose.Total for SSRS and Silverlight Viewer.

Aspose are file format experts. Their development tools can be used with other tools to create a complete toolkit of products for viewing and exporting data.
