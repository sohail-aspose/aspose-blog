We are pleased to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for JasperReports 18.3.

This release has been built on the basis of latest Aspose.Slides for Java 18.3 API whereby we have included support for setting fonts for exported HTML. Moreover, the rendering support for charts, text and table has also been improved in API. We have also included support for embed fonts in PPTX as well for Aspose.Slides for JasperReport. Some issues related to export of report to presentation have been fixed that earlier resulted in exceptions.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for JasperReports 18.3 Release Notes][1] for further reference.
