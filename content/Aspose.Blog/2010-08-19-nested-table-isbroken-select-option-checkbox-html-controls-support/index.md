Memory Utilization while transforming large TIFF images into PDF format has greatly been controlled in latest release version of Aspose.Pdf for .NET. Some of the issues regarding IsBroken when working with Nested tables are also resolved. On top of all this, support for some great HTML controls like Select, Option, TextArea, CheckBox and Text has been provided. So now with this new version,Â HTML controls are displayed as it is over the resultant PDF (user can interact with them) rather than static snapshots of controls.
