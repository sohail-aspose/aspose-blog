[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/aspose-Barcode-for-net_100.png)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.BarCode for .NET 6.3.0. The most common use for barcode recognition is quick and reliable document identification and indexing. This new release offers fast and accurate reading of supported barcodes like DataMatrix, Code128 and Code39 codes.

Two fixes are made to recognize Code39 correctly from PDF file format. The same was the case with Code128 codes in TIFF format. We can now recognize accurate barcode values from their source files. Another improvement area is the recognition of DataMatrix code from TIFF files. In this regard, the barcode recognition failure problem has been downgraded.

To view a complete list of new features, fixes and enhancements [download the new release of Aspose.BarCode for .NET][2].
