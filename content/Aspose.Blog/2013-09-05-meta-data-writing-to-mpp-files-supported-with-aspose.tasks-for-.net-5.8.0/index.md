[![Aspose.Tasks for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Tasks-for-net_100.png)Aspose.Tasks for .NET 5.8.0 has been released.

With this month's release, we have introduced a new feature that allows you to write metadata to MPP files. This includes writing calendar, task, tasklink, resource and resource assignment metadata to MPP as explained in the article.

This month's release also includes a number of bug fixes related to MPP files. These include display of tasks as summary tasks when MPP files were re-saved using Aspose.Tasks, writing baseline work and costs for Microsoft Project 2013 MPP files,Â  getting the wrong Gantt chart view, and some Chinese language issues for task notes.

For more details on new features and bug fixes, please visit the [Product Release Page][2].
