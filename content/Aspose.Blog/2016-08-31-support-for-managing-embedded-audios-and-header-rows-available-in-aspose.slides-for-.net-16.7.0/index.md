[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We are pleased to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for .NET 16.7.0. This is primarily a maintenance release whereby we have resolved many issues incurring in API.

## New Features

We have introduced the support for removing the embedded audio inside presentation in this release and with this feature you can now remove the embedded audios if it is intended. We have also introduced the support for enabling Header rows or banned rows for tables inside slide and you can now use this feature to add Header rows.

## Resolved Issues

We have improved the mechanism for Fonts Substitute rules in this API for better font replacements and have also rectified issue while setting DefaultRegularFont for text. We have also resolved certain pending issue like improper fonts, wrong arrow directions, wrong background colors, improper and wrong bullets and improper border for generated PDF or slide thumbnails.

The issues of wrong shape colors and missing elements during slide cloning have also been addressed. Moreover, issues related to charts and their elements rendering have been taken care of in this release. Working with tables and SmartArt shapes have been improved as well after resolution of certain incurring issues. The support for generating of slide images, PDF and Tiff has also been improved in this release for different shape elements inside presentation decks.

The presentation access and saving issues have been rectified for many presentation decks that resulted in exceptions including KeyNotFoundException, IndexOutOfRangeException, ArgumentException, UnSupportedFormatException and PptReadException in previous releases.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to Aspose.Slides for .NET 16.7.0 Release Notes for further reference.
