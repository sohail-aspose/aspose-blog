We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.OCR for Java 17.03. This release includes improved image skew correction mechanism with better EigenPoints selection and grouping. An improved metered licensing process is also part of this release. Bugs reported by our customers have been fixed due to which overall performance of the API is also improved in this release.

## Enhancements

This month’s release includes the following enhancements.

*   The working of the metered licensing mechanism has been improved. The API will switch to the unpaid mode in case if it fails while uploading consumption data. Custom HostnameVerifier has been removed.
*   Processing of skewed image to deskew it has been improved. An improvement in algorithm to angle detection of the rotated image has been made.

Since all the enhancements are internal to the API, there are no public API changes from the end user's point of view, and the features can be used readily with this new version.
