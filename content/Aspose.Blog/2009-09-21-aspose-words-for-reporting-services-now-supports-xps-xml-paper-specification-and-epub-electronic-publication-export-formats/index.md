We are glad to announce a new release of Aspose.Words for Reporting Services. We have added the support for two new export formats, namely XPS (XML Paper Specification) and EPUB (Electronic Publication). Also, the new version is based on Aspose.Words for .NET 7.0 that was recently published, too (don't forget to check out the new field update feature, by the way :) ).
