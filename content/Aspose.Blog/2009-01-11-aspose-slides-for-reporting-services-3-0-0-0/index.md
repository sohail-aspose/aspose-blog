The long-awaited Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services with full support of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 is here. All new introduced RDL elements are supported!  
We tried to make exported presentation look as close as possible to a report exported with standard TIFF image exporter.  
  
Also there is new installer available which should automatically install Aspose.Slides to all existing instances of Reporting Services 2005 and 2008.  
In case of any automatic installation errors please use manual installation which is described in the documentation.  
  
Please check [download link][1].
