We are glad to announce a new release **Aspose.HTML for .NET 18.4** which is available on NuGet Gallery for download and to be used in .NET applications. We have enhanced the feature of rendering the HTML files to image files. Furthermore, we also have rectified the anomalies reported in the earlier version(s) of Aspose.HTML for .NET. An overview of the improvements and changes is given in the [release notes][1] of Aspose.HTML for .NET 18.4.

In the latest version of Aspose.HTML for .NET, parsing of Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) has been improved and we have focused especially that API parses CSS without missing any property or tag. Thus improving the rendering of an HTML file to a PDF, XPS, and other supported file formats.
