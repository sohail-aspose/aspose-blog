We are pleased to announce that the new version 18.5 of [Aspose.Diagram][1] API is now live. The recent version 18.5 has included improvements to preserve the actual gradient color of Visio shapes on running export operations. The enhancements have been made to normalize the magnified text characters during VSD to image export and preserve the missing OLE objects. The recent version 18.5 also covers the regular bug fixes. We recommend our client use the latest upgrade of Aspose.Diagram API to take benefit of improved functionality and bug fixes.
