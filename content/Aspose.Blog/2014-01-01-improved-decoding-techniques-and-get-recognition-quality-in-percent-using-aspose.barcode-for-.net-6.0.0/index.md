[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/aspose-Barcode-for-net_100.png)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.BarCode for .NET 6.0.0. This release focuses more on decoding techniques to improve recognition quality and performance. Our barcode library for the Microsoft .NET Compact Framework has also been improved with appropriate error messages and enhanced reliability.

With this new version, you can also get barcode recognition quality in percent. The BarCodeReader.GetRecognitionQuality method allows you to do that. You can find the details of this feature in the following help topic: Get BarCode Recognition Quality in Percent.

The DataMatrix performance with large pictures has been upgraded. Key factors of this improvement are “Diagonal check” and “Strict angle check”. One more valuable enhancement is to generate multiple barcodes on a single image. You can find the details of this feature in the following help topic:  Generate Multiple Barcodes on a Single Image.

Various other noteworthy developments have been made to improve the overall recognition techniques of the DataMatrix, Code128 and Pdf417 symbologies. Through these developments, the decoding accuracy rate of DataMatrix and Code128 symbologies from an image and PDF file format is noticeably better.

This new release also enhances PDF417 barcode encoding in compaction mode and includes all carriage returns. The Code128 encoding has improved the presence of FNC characters. Previously, it generated incorrect code when a few FNC characters were present.

To view a complete list of new features, fixes and enhancements [download the new release of Aspose.BarCode for .NET][2].
