We like to share the announcement of a hotfix release of Aspose.Slides for Java 2.9.5. This is a maintenance release and most of the slide rendering issues reported in previous versions have been fixed in this new release. Issues with bullets, charts, shapes and slide backgrounds have been resolved in exported PDF and generated thumbnails. The presentation rendering issues in JDK 1.5, along with in rendering issues in Linux environments, have also been addressed in this new release. Some presentation access and slide cloning issues have also been rectified.

To see a complete list of fixes and to download Aspose.Slides for Java 2.9.5, [please visit the download page][2].
