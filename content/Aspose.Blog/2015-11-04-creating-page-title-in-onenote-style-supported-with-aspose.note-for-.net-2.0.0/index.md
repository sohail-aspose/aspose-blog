We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Note for .NET 2.0.0][2]. This month’s release provides the capability of creating a page title in Microsoft Office OneNote style format. It also fixes a number of bugs reported with our last month’s release. You can visit our product documentation to check for all the API changes in this month’s release.

# Creating Page Title in MS OneNote Style

A standard page title in MS OneNote document is as shown in the following image. Aspose.Note API did not have the facility of creating such a page title until this release. This month’s release introduces new properties to the _TextStyle_ class that can be used to generate such a page title in MS OneNote document. These properties are:

*   _TextStyle.DefaultMsOneNoteTitleTextStyle_
*   _TextStyle.DefaultMsOneNoteTitleDateStyle_
*   _TextStyle.DeafultMsOneNoteTitleTimeStyle_
