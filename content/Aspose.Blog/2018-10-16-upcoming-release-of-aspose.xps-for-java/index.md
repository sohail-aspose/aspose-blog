We at Aspose are pleased to announce launching of new product **[Aspose.XPS for Java][1]**. Considering the overwhelming response for recently released .NET API, we have decided to extend its supported platforms by introducing the API for Java based environments. This API is intended to perform conversion of XPS documents to supported file formats (and vice versa). In addition to this, it will also offer features to create, edit and manipulate XPS documents in Java Applications. It will enable you to utilize the API inÂ Desktop GUI Applications, Web Applications and Console Applications etc.

## Features offered by Aspose.XPS for Java

First stable release of Aspose.XPS for Java will be rich in features which are imperative for creation of new XPS documents, as well as for manipulation of existing XPS documents. It will include several classes which expose different properties and methods to create, manipulate and save XPS documents. You will be able to create and edit XPS documents, pages, canvases, paths and glyphs as per your requirements. Aspose.XPS for Java API will also enable you to create vector graphic shapes. An overview of the features offered by the API is as under:

*   Manipulate the appearance of graphics and text strings
*   Specify colors in different color spaces including sRGB, scRGB and any space based on ICC profile
*   Working with different Elements including Canvases, Paths and Glyphs
