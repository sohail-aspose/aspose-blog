[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/07/aspose-Email-for-net_100.png)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Email for .NET 4.3.0. This month’s release includes new features, enhancements and bug fixes that further improve the overall functionality of the API. You may visit the [product download page][2] to get a detailed idea about what is new and fixed, and download this latest version of Aspose.Email for .NET. You can share your feedback with us by writing to us on the [Aspose.Email forum][3] and visit the Public API Changes section of our documentation for public API and backward incompatible changes in the API.

## Adding Attachments to Messages with TNEF Attachments

Aspose.Email can already process email messages that contain Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) attachments. Not only can it convert and save such messages to regular email messages, it can process the TNEF attachments and modify their contents while saving them back in the same format. This month’s release further improves the functionality of the Aspose.Email API for adding attachments to such messages that was not supported earlier.

## Reading Named MAPI Property from Message Attachments

With our previous releases, the API allowed you to search for named MAPI properties. This worked for a message store of main message only and didn’t support reading the properties of message attachments. This month’s release now provides the ability to search for named MAPI properties from message attachments as shown in the online article Reading Name MAPI Property from Attachment.

## Bug Fixes

This month’s release also contains a number of bug fixes related to different functional areas of Aspose.Email. These include:

*   Issues related to message conversion, resulting in lost encoding.
*   Message drag & drop functionality.
*   POP3 and IMAP clients.
*   TNEF message formats.
*   Large size PST creation.
*   Exceptions while loading different mail items such as messages and calendar items.
