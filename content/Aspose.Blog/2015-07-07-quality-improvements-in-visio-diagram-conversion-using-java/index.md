We are pleased to announce the new release version of [Aspose.Diagram for Java 5.4.0][1]. The Visio file conversion feature has the highest utilization level because recreating files is time-consuming though, so users preferred to convert it into other file formats from some reliable source. Each release of Aspose.Diagram APIs lead to add some improvement in the export feature. We're serving our customers and clients, and providing an engine to help them in growing their business.

In this new release version, we have covered the problems of empty output documents, changed background color of the page in output files, black boxes in place of the picture shapes and the corrupted output documents. Please check a list of fixed issues below:
