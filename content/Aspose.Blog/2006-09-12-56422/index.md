In the previous topic I forgot to really tell why support for drawing objects in Aspose.Words for .NET 4.0 is really AWesome.

Current support for drawing objects in Aspose.Words for .NET 4.0 is by far the most thorough and comprehensive comparing to any existing competing commercial or open source packages. Support for drawing objects is only better of course in Microsoft Word itself.

There is also the high-fidelity conversion from DOC to RTF and WordprocessingML without losing any of the formatting.

The same level of support for drawing objects will soon be available in Aspose.Words for Java too.

Here screenshots of one of the hundreds of test documents we use for regression tests. It shows how the original DOC file looks after open-save cycle in Aspose.Words for .NET 4.0 to DOC, RTF and WordprocessingML. None of the complex shape elements and formatting is lost.

_Currently, this is is not possible in any software in the world other than Microsoft Word and Aspose.Words._
