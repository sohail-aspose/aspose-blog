[![Aspose.Note for Java][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/aspose_note-for-java.png)[Aspose.Note for Java 16.12.0][2] has been released. Ported form its equivalent .NET version, this month’s release provides support for images and attachments data in Microsoft OneNote Online file format. It also fixes several bugs as part of porting from its equivalent .NET version. Fixing these bugs brings further improvements to the API functionality. Aspose.Note for Java release notes can be referred for details about all the changes that are part of this month’s release.

# Support for Images and Attachments Data for OneNote Online File Format

We are pleased to share that Aspose.Note for Java now provides support for images and attachments while manipulating Microsoft OneNote online file format. Such flies can be created using Microsoft SharePoint online. We provided support for this file format in one of our [earlier releases][3] with the limitations that images and attachments could not be read from such documents. As a result, a file of this type read and saved back using the API also lost any such data.

With this new release, we were successful in interpreting these two types of data and now you can manipulate such document without any loss. There are no public API changes for incorporation of this functionality in applications and the feature can be used readily with this new version of the API.

# Other Improvements

This month’s release also fixes certain issues that were reported with the last version of the API. This further improves the API functionality in terms of reliability and performance.
