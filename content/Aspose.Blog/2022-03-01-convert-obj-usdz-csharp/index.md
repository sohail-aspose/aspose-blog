An [OBJ][1] file is a geometry definition file format that can contain texture maps, polygonal faces, and 3D coordinates. You may need to convert an OBJ file to a [USDZ][2] file for certain requirements. This article covers how to convert OBJ to USDZ file programmatically in C#.  USDZ files are useful while manipulating graphics as they can contain 3D geometry and shading data. Moreover, they are popularly used to create augmented reality scenes.
