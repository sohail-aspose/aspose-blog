We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Imaging for .NET 16.12. The major development in this release is support for [exporting images in multi threaded environment][1]. This release supports [converting EMF metafile to WMF format][2]. Support for [DNG format][3] has also been incorporated in this release.

## Convert EMF to WMF using C#

Using Aspose.Imaging for .Net developers can [convert EMF to WMF format][4]. The below code demonstrates how EMF metafile can be converted to WMF metafile format.

## Export Images in Multi-Threaded Environment

Aspose.Imaging for .Net now supports [exporting images in multi threaded environment][5]. Aspose.Imaging for .Net ensure the optimized performance of operations during execution of code in multi-threaded environment. All imaging option classes (e.g. BmpOptions, TiffOptions, JpegOptions, etc.) in the Aspose.Imaging for .Net now implement IDisposable interface. Therefore it is a must that developer properly dispose off the imaging options class object in case Source property is set. Following code snippet demonstrates the said functionality.

Aspose.Imaging now supports SyncRoot property while working in multi-threaded environment. Developer can use this property to synchronize access to the source stream. Following code snippet demonstrates how the SyncRoot property can be used.

## Support for DNG Image

Aspose.Imaging for .Net now supports the DNG (Digital Negative) image format (.dng). It is a publicly available archival format for the raw files generated by digital cameras. DNG helps ensure that photographers will be able to access their files in the future. Aspose.Imaging for .Net provides the DngImage class to load DNG files and same can be used to convert the DNG to raster formats. Below provided sample code demonstrate how to [convert a DNG file to JPEG format][6].
