We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 17.3.

We have provided the support for Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services to get it working in SharePoint 2016 integration mode. Moreover, this release has been built on the basis of latest Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.3, which has been released with improved chart element, tables and presentation rendering support. The improved rendering support in Aspose.Slides for .NET will achieve better rendering of SQL Server reports when exporting to PowerPoint or other formats using Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 17.3 Release Notes][1] for further reference.
