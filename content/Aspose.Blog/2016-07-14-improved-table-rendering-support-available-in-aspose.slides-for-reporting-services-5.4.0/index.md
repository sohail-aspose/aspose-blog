We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 5.4.0.

This is primarily a maintenance release whereby we have resolved several issues incurring in API during presentation export. This new release has been built based on latest version of Aspose.Slides for .NET. We have addressed the table rendering issues including cells border appearance and default font size for text inside table cells. The issue related to long text visibility inside table cells has also been rectified.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 5.4.0 Release Notes for further reference.
