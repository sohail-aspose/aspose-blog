[![Aspose.Diagram for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/06/aspose-Diagram-for-net_100.png)We're pleased to announce the new release version of Aspose.Diagram for .NET 5.4.0. This version is full of improvements to layout stability and quality as well as some additional error message fixes. For textual rendering, shape's position and its availability, users can notice many of bug fixes as well as improved export features which mimics the behavior of Microsoft Office Visio.

## Improved Text Items Rendering and Error Fixes

The conversion feature manages the extensive information and we consider its critics. During the export of the Windows UI, Organizational Chart and many other Engineering diagrams, users were facing problems of shifting text from the original position, distorted text items and some shapes were also missing. These fixes improve Aspose APIs, quality, execution and performance levels.

In the recent release version, we have also fixed some error messages, those users were facing during the loading or export operations. Please check a list of fixed issues below:

*   Fixed: Shape is missing from the output HTML format.
    
*   Fixed: VSD to PDF conversion, form tab's text is shifted down.
    
*   Fixed: VSD to VDX conversion, shapes are missing from the diagram.
    
*   Fixed: Index outside the bounds error when loaded a VSD diagram.
    
*   Fixed: VSD, VST, VSS to PDF conversion, the text items is messed up.
    
*   Fixed: VSDX to PDF conversion, the diagram shape values should be hidden.
    
*   Fixed: VSD to PNG, PDF, HTML conversion, Index out of range error occurred.
