"Export to Word Plugin" for dotCMS allows users to export online content into Word Processing documents using [Aspose.Words for Java][1]. It dynamically exports the content of the Web page to a Word Processing document and then automatically downloads the file to the disk location selected by the user in just a couple of seconds. The generated Word processing document can then be opened using any Word Processing Application such as Microsoft Word or Apache OpenOffice etc.
