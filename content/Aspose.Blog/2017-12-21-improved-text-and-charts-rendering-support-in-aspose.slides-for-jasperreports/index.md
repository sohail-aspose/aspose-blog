We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for JasperReports 17.12.

This release has been built on the basis of latest Aspose.Slides for Java 17.12 API, which is enriched with improved text, chart and tables rendering support while exporting to PDF and generating slide thumbnails. The improved rendering will thus be helpful in generating presentation files from JasperReports.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for JasperReports 17.12 Release Notes][2] for further reference.
