[![Aspose.Diagram for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/06/aspose-Diagram-for-net_100.png)We're pleased to announce the new release version of Aspose.Diagram for .NET 5.6.0. It covers a new feature support, to update a particular Milestone content on the Timeline shape. We're gradually incorporating advance feature operations and also fixing maintenance defects. We have also included many other formatting and Visio diagram export improvements.

## Update Milestone Dates

It becomes an easy approach for users to capture and communicate project milestones with a timeline. In this regard, Aspose.Diagram has already added support to configure Visio Timeline shapes. From this release version, users will also be able to update a particular Milestone shape's date. MilestoneHelper class allows to do so. Please refer to the following help topic: Refresh Milestones on the Timeline using MilestoneHelper class

In the recent release version, we have improved its export quality, data retrieval mechanism, preserving formatting and structure found in the source diagrams. Please check a list of fixed defects:

*   Fixed: Missing shape's parts when saving in VDX format.
    
*   Fixed: VSDX to PDF conversion, the filled color of the shapes is not preserved.
    
*   Fixed: VSDX to PDF conversion, the arrow signs of all connectors are not preserved.
    
*   Fixed: Can't determine connected shapes in the VSD diagram.
    
*   Fixed: Connectors are not being routed correctly in the resultant VDX.
    
*   Fixed: Foreground page turns into the background page.
    
*   Fixed: VSDX to SVG conversion, "&" character in the text appear as "&amp;".
    
*   Fixed: VSDX to SVG conversion, the shape's text lines are interchanged.
    
*   Fixed: Warning message when opening resultant VDX diagram.
    
*   Fixed: Can't retrieve the shape's name from a VSD diagram.
    

## Public API Changes

The following API changes in the new version are also worth noting:

*   The new RefreshMilestone method has been added to the MilesstoneHelper class. It updates a Milestone shape's date available on the Timeline.
