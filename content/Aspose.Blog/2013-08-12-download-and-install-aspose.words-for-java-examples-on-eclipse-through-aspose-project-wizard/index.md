In August, we released Aspose Project Wizard for the Eclipse IDE, which helps install Aspose for Java JAR files. Now we have integrated Aspose.Words for Java examples in the [latest release of the Wizard][1]. An Eclipse project created through this wizard does not need to know the location of the latest Aspose.Words for Java JAR files and the respective code examples repository on Github. Java developers who use Eclipse to write Java just need to install [Aspose Project Wizard][2] like any other plugin.

## Installing Aspose.Words for Java binaries and examples

Upon installation, the Aspose plugin adds a new option - **New Aspose Project** on the **Files** menu in Eclipse. To install and run the latest Aspose.Words for Java binaries and examples, just follow the simple steps below:

*   Launch **New Aspose Project** wizard.
*   Select **Aspose.Words** and click **Finish.**
