   We have no update for our build for more than 4 months. During this time, we have made significant improvement in performance and memory efficiency. Namely, it works faster and consumes lower memory now, especially for large tables processing. In our test, the performance for normal XML2PDF is improved for 60% on average and the performance for Word2PDF is improved for 30% on average. The performance for generating very large PDF has not been resolved yet. We are working on this issue and try to provide hotfix ASAP.  
  In this new version we canceled these beta features: Fo2Pdf and Html2Pdf temporarily. We will include them in our further release when they are mature. Old customers that using these features can still seek help from us.
