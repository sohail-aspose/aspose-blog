We have just published version 1.7.0 of Aspose.Email for .NET and Java. This monthâ€™s release provides support for the creation of TNEF message files, setting Appointment's time zone information from an instance of System.TimeZoneInfo and detect Outlook message type using the MapiMessage class.

An important enhancement has been made so that the MHTML renderer includes the embedded images as well as the email header in the output. We have also fixed some issues regarding embedded images, encoding, attachments for EML to MSG conversion.

Read the release notes to get a full list of the new enhancements and fixes included in [Aspose.Email for .NET 1.7.0][2] and [Aspose.Email for Java v1.7.0][3].
