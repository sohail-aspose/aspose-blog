The [Auckland .NET user group][2] is a bi-monthly meetup of around 60-100 different members each month. Topics discussed included e topics include any part of the .NET framework, web technology or Windows apps.

Aspose loves getting behind developers in the community which is why we are sponsoring the Auckland .NET user group. Aspose will be supplying the food and drinks for this event. We recommend if you are in in the neighbourhood to go [check them out][3].

## What's in Store?

The first talk will be from Raza Rad who will show you the amazing things you can do with Power BI. In this session you will learn through many live demos how to get most of Power BI for real world scenarios. You will learn how easy is to build a Power BI report and dashboard on top of a transactional database. You will be also familiar with Custom Visuals, and how to use them in your solution.

Reza Rad is an Author, Trainer, Speaker and DW/BI Consultant, and has more than 15 years experience in databases, programming and development mostly on Microsoft technologies. He is a Microsoft MVP in SQL Server for six continuous years (from 2011) for his dedication in Microsoft BI.

The second talk will be a remote presentation by David Roberts from Minnesota and Adam Kruszewski from Poland who will talk about their application RevDeBug for .NET.

RevDeBug for .NET records what an application does “under the hood” on each line of code and allows you to step backwards in time, which helps in finding the root causes of bugs. Finally you don’t need to restart your debugging session over and over again. Now you can trace the root cause of bugs just by stepping back in time.
