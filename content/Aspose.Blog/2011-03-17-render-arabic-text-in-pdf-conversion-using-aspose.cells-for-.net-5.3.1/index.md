We have released the Aspose.Cells for .NET v5.3.1 for the users.

In this version, we have provided support to render Arabic text in PDF conversion. The web control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET now allows selecting multiple cells using “CTRL” key. Moreover, both windows and web controls provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET support to calculate Array constants in Formulas, e.g. =SUM ({1, 2, 3, 4}).

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
