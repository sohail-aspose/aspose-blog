We have released a new version of Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET. In this version (Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET 3.6.0.0) we have added a new feature to get the currently selected value of the radio group and to determine all the valid radio group values. We have also improved and fixed some other features as well.  
  
PdfViewer, PdfConverter, PdfFileEditor and Form are the main classes which received special attention of our Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET developers during the development of this release. We have also improved file encryption and signature features.  
  
You can see the complete list of changes and download the latest version from the [Aspose.Pdf.Kit download section][1].
