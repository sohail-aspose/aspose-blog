We feel happy to announce the news of release of Aspose.Slides for .NET 5.3.0. This is one of major product release that has included the maiden support for SmartArt rendering. Another great thing about this product is that Aspose.Slides for .NET is no longer dependent on Aspose.Cells for .NET for rendering charts. The chart support has been completely rewritten and sample codes can be found in the documentation. The missing support for scattered charts with multiple series and markers support for chart series has also been included in this new release.

The PPT to PPTX conversion features have also been improved by addition of auto shapes, OLE object and multimedia objects reading while conversion. Many of slide rendering and cloning issues have also been addressed in this new release. We have also enhanced the capability of our product by adding more enriched support for PowerPoint 2010 presentations.
