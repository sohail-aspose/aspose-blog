We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for Java 16.3.0. It comes with the improved support for the presentation rendering, along with many bug fixes.

## New Features

We have introduced the support for setting and getting the slide size while exporting a presentation to PDF or PDF notes. Please visit the documentation article [Converting a presentation to PDF][1] for further reference. We have also added a new feature of setting second series plot options by adding new methods getPieSplitPosition(), getPieSplitBy(), getSecondPieSize() which may be used while working with PieOfPie or BarOfPie charts. For more details on these newly added methods, one may visit the documentation article [Second plot options for Pie of Pie and Bar of Pie chart][2] for further reference. We have also added support to generate thumbnail of SmartArt node. Please visit the documentation article [Creating Shape Thumbnails][3] for more details and sample code.

## Resolved Issues

The issues related to HTML generation, including incorrect text alignment, missing images, missing background, and incorrect color of text box have been fixed in this release. Some issues which were appearing in previous versions while working with ODP files, including missing charts, missing text, and misplaced contents have also been addressed in this release. Support for image rendering has also been improved in this release. The presentation access and saving issues have been rectified for many presentation decks that resulted in exceptions including PptxReadException, ArgumentException, KeyNotFoundException, and ArgumentOutOfRangeException in previous releases.

Many chart rendering issues including missing or improper chart legends, chart categories, and axes have been rectified. The issues related to the extraction of some document properties including Author and Last Modified By have also been addressed. We have taken care of the issues reported while loading or saving a presentation file with Aspose.Slides and this release is better in performance as compared to earlier versions of Aspose.Slides for Java

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for Java 16.3.0 Release Notes][4] for further reference.
