Hot fix contains:  

*   Fixed: Tiny size of OLE objects on cloned slide after updating object.
*   Fixed: Removed Russian characters in the template files so it doesn't appear on presentations or slides created from scratch anymore.
*   Fixed: Read/write/clone slides (probably with support of right-to-left writing).
