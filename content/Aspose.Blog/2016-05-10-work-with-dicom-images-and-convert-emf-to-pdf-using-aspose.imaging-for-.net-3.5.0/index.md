We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Imaging for .NET 3.5.0. The major development in this release is [support for DICOM image][1] and [support for EMF format][2]. This release allows you to [blur an image][3] and [import image to PSD layer][4]. Support to [apply correction filters on images][5] has also been incorporated in this release.

## Convert EMF Files to PDF using C#

Using Aspose.Imaging for .NET, developers can convert EMF metafile to PDF format. Aspose.Imaging for .NET provides the EmfImage class to load EMF files and the same can be used to save the image to PDF format. Below provided sample code demonstrates how to convert EMF to PDF.

## Work with DICOM Images using C#

Aspose.Imaging for .NET now [supports the DICOM image format(.dicom)][6]. DICOM stands for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine. DICOM is a standard for handling, storing, printing, and transmitting information in medical imaging. It includes a file format definition and a network communications protocol.

The following is the list of operations that can be performed on a DICOM image using Aspose.Imaging:

*   [Adjusting Brightness, Contrast and Gamma][7]
*   [Applying Filters][8]
*   [Applying Binarization][9]
*   [Cropping Image][10]
*   [Cropping by Shifts][11]
*   [Dithering For DICOM Image][12]
*   [Resizing DICOM Image][13]
*   [Rotate and Flip DICOM Image][14]
*   [Export to DICOM][15]
*   [Memory strategy optimization][16]

## Blur An Image using C#

Using Aspose.Imaging for .NET API, developers can [create blur effect on an image][17]. Following is the code demonstrating the use of GaussianBlurFilterOptions class.

## Import Image To PSD Layer using C#

Using Aspose.Imaging for .NET API, developers can [import image into a PSD file][18]. Aspose.Imaging for .NET has exposed the DrawImage method of the Layer class to add/import an image into a PSD file. DrawImage method needs location and image values to add/import an image into a PSD file. The following code example demonstrates how to import an image into PSD file.
