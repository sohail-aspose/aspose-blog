We have released the Aspose.Cells for .NET v5.3.2 for the users now. In this version, we have supported MS Excel 2010 encryption types. You can insert a common value into all the cells of a given range. Moreover, we have made enhancements for printing options, you can disable or hide Printing-Process dialog box for your need, and you can also change the paper’s source while printing spreadsheets. The web control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET, now allows you to set grouped rows as “Expanded” or “Collapsed” on the client side. There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
