We are pleased to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Jasper Reports 18.5.

This release has been built on the basis of latest Aspose.Slides for Java 18.5 API, whereby we have included support for improved SmartArt shapes management. The presentation rendering support has also been improved in API while exporting to PDF or slide thumbnails.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for Jasper Reports 18.5 Release Notes][2] for further reference.
