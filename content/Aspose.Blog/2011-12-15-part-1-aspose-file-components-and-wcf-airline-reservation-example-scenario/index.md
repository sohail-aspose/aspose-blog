## Aspose File Format Components for .NET

![Aspose.Total icon][1][Aspose.Total for .NET file format components][2] allow you to create, manipulate, convert and print various types of files in your .NET applications. These components provide APIs as .NET assemblies which can be used in different types of .NET applications i.e. Windows Forms, Web Forms, Windows Services, MVC, and WCF etc. You can use Aspose APIs to incorporate file processing features in your .NET applications small or large.

## Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)

[Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)][3] is a part of the .NET Framework that provides a unified programming model for rapidly building service-oriented applications that communicate across the web and enterprise. Before the WCF, building service-oriented applications would require a variety of communication technologies, whereas WCF provides a single unified model.

## Introduction to the Tutorial

In this multi-part tutorial, I'll explain how you can add file creation and manipulate features in WCF applications using Aspose.Total for .NET. We'll take an example of a fictitious airline company named "FlyNow Airline" and build a small airline booking service. In this example, we'll not only create the service, but also a client application to consume this service. We'll add file formatting features, for different purposes, both in the service and the client application.

## The Airline Reservation Scenario

The FlyNow Airline wants to build a booking system using WCF. They also want to add some file formatting features in this service, which is a very important part of the system. So, they're interested in reliable file format components. The airline will expose a service which will be able to provide airline information and then book a seat for the passenger.

The service will also create ticket in the PDF format and then send the ticket to the passenger via email. In the ticket, they also want to add bar codes. Due to the FlyNow Airline's particular requirement, the service also needs to create an Excel file containing complete booking and passenger information.

In addition to the booking service, the company is also interested in a Windows Forms based client application which allows their agents to not only book the seat, but also print invoices for the passenger when they purchase a ticket.

## Where to use Aspose File Components?

We'll use different Aspose components to add file creation features in the service, and invoice printing feature in the client application. We'll use the following components:

*   [Aspose.BarCode][4] for .NET to create bar codes to be placed on the tickets.
*   [Aspose.Pdf for .NET][5] to create tickets in PDF format.
*   [Aspose.Email for .NET][6] to send the ticket as email to the passenger.
*   [Aspose.Cells for .NET][7] to create Excel file containing complete flight and passenger information.
*   [Aspose.Pdf for .NET][8] to print the invoice in the client application.

## What's Next?

In the next part of this tutorial, I'll elaborate the application architecture and other details of building and setting up the environment for this sample application. After that, I'll show you the actual code of the application, and in the last part of the series, a screencast will be shared with you showing all the steps of building this sample application and adding file processing features. So, stay tuned!
