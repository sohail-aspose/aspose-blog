There has been a complaint that memory consumption and processing time is significantly increasing when processing large tables. In order to get these issues resolved, a new feature of adding a table (Row-by-Row) directly to the file has been introduced, which has considerably reduced the memory consumption and processing time. Beside this,Â the enormous feature of generating PDF/A compliant documents using Aspose.Pdf for .NET is out of Beta phase and is fully available.

Nevertheless, some serious issues like StackOverflowException, Mirror margin, VerticalAlignmentType, Top margin for images, Text Wrapping and some Header/Footer issues are also corrected.

In order to view a complete list of new features and fixes and to download the latest hotfix of Aspose.Pdf for .NET 4.1.1, please visit [Download Section][1].
