## Steps to Generate PDF from Images {#Steps-to-Generate-a-PDF-File-from-Image}

The following are the steps that we will follow to generate a PDF file from images in this article.

*   First, create a new PDF document.
*   Get the list of the images' file names in an array.
*   For each image file in the list, do the following:
    *   Add a new page to the PDF document and set its properties.
    *   Load each image file in a file stream from the list.
    *   Add image to the paragraph collection of the page.
*   Finally, save the PDF document.

## Generate PDF from Images using Java {#Generate-PDF-from-Images-using-Java}

Let's now check out how to implement each of the above-mentioned steps using Aspose.PDF for Java.

*   Create an instance of [Document][9] class.
*   Get the list of the images' file names in an array using the [java.io.File][10] class.
*   For each image file in the list, do the following:
    
    *   Add a new [Page][11] to the PDF document using [Document.getPages().add()][12] method and set page's properties.
    *   Load the image file into a [FileInputStream][13] object.
    *   Add a new [Image][14] to the page using [Page.getParagraphs().add(Image)][15] method.
    
    *   Set image's stream using [Image.setImageStream(FileInputStream)][16] method.
*   Finally, save the PDF document using [Document.save(String)][17] method.

The following code sample shows how to generate PDF file from images in Java.
