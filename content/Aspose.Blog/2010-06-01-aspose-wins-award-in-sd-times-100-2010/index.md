**USA, Texas – June 1, 2010** **–**  SD Times, the software development magazine, recognises the innovation and leadership of companies, non-profit organisations, open source projects and other initiatives. This year, Aspose was included in the Components & Libraries category.

It is very pleasing to see our customer focus and hard work recognised by a body like the SD Times, independent experts and thought-leaders in the industry. The SD Times 100 is not a product award but awards leadership in a variety of software development industry areas. Nominations are submitted by SD Times readers and editors and winners are selected by the SD Times editors.

Aspose are grateful to have received the award. We hope that our customer focus, ongoing innovation and hard work will continue to impress both our customers and the SD Times.

You can find the full list of winners at the SD Times website.
