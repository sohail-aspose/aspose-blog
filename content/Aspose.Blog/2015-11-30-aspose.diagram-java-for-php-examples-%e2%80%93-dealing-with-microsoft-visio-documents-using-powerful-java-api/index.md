We are pleased to announce “[Aspose.Diagram Java for PHP][1]”, a new package for PHP developers. The project is aimed to provide useful examples for PHP developers who want to utilize “[Aspose.Diagram for Java][2]” in their PHP applications for creating, reading, modifying, and converting MS Visio diagrams.

[Aspose.Diagram for Java][3] is an easy-to-use, high-performance, and well-documented library that works with VSD, VSDX, VSS, VST, VSX, VTX, VDW and VDX files in Java applications without the need to rely on Microsoft Office Visio®. It allows developers to open files and manipulate the elements of the diagram or create a diagram from scratch and place various elements, from lines and fills, to more complex elements, and then export to VDX, VSX, VTX, XPS, HTML, SVG, SWF, XAML, image or PDF formats.
