We are very much excited to announce the first public release of Aspose.HTML for Java. As shared in the [pre-release blog of Aspose.HTML for Java][1], this API offers the capabilities to create as well as manipulate HTML documents in Java applications. Prior to the release of Aspose.HTML for Java, we already have published [Aspose.HTML for .NET][2] which facilitates the developers to create, read, edit HTML documents including CSS styles and render to PDF & raster image formats. Therefore in order to provide similar features to our customers developing applications on Java platform, we have ported the features of current Aspose.HTML for .NET to the new sibling, Aspose.Html for Java. This API enables developers to programmatically create and manipulate HTML documents, whether simple or complex and on the fly.

## Conversion to/from HTML

Earlier to the release of this API, we have an API named Aspose.Words for Java which primarily offers the capabilities to create as well as manipulate existing MS Word files. Apart from MS Word files manipulation, it also provides the capabilities to convert HTML files to PDF format. Furthermore, we also have another API named Aspose.PDF for Java, which provides the features to create as well as manipulate existing PDF files. It is also capable of performing [HTML files to PDF format][3] but both of these APIs do not support the feature to manipulate HTML files and its contents. Therefore in order to cater the requirement to Insert, Remove, Replace HTML nodes, extract CSS style information, Navigate through HTML document either by NodeIterator, TreeWalker that are provided by Traversal Specifications, XPath or CSS selector queries, we have introduced this new API. Apart from earlier mentioned features, this API also offers scripting which allows manipulating HTML DOM via JavaScript. Along with HTML, this API also provides the capabilities to load EPUB and MHTML files.

## Native HTML to PDF Conversion

As mentioned earlier, Aspose.Words and Aspose.PDF provide the capabilities to render HTML files to PDF format, but in order to have better support for this feature, we have natively provided HTML to PDF rendering support in Aspose.HTML for Java, so that our customers do not have to use multiple APIs when dealing with HTML files and rendering them to PDF format. Please note that Aspose APIs are famous for their inter file format conversion features and this API also provides the capabilities to load HTML file and render the output in XPS and raster image formats including JPEG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF. When generating the output in PDF format, you can also encrypt the document, specify the page setup information for resultant output and we can also specify the compression value for JPEG images inside the output document.
