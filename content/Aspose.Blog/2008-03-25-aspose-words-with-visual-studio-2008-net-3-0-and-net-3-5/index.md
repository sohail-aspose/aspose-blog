**Yes, it works.**

We will continue to ship two assemblies: bin\\net1.1\\Aspose.Words.dll and bin\\net2.0\\Aspose.Words.dll built for .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0 respectively.

**bin\\net2.0\\Aspose.Words.dll isÂ to be used with:**

*   Visual Studio 2005
*   Visual Studio 2008
*   .NET Framework 2.0 (with or without SP1)
*   .NET Framework 3.0 (with or without SP1)
*   .NET Framework 3.5
*   x86 or x64 application

bin\\net2.0\\Aspose.Words.dll will continue to target .NET Framework 2.0 because it does not use any .NET 3.0 or 3.5 features. A good MSDN article [.NET Framework 3.5 Archiecture][1].aspx) has more info about this.  

**bin\\net1.1\\Aspose.Words.dll is to be used with:**

*   Visual Studio 2003
*   Visual Studio 2002
*   .NET Framework 1.1 (with or without SP)
*   .NET Framework 1.0 (you need to create a configuration file as shown in the Aspose.Words documentation)
