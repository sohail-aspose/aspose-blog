[Aspose.Email for Java 6.7.0][1] has been released. This month’s release is a sort of maintenance release with minor enhancements as well. Ported from its equivalent .NET version, it also includes the same bug fixes as were part of the .NET equivalent version. For a complete list of what is new and fixed, please visit our Product download page for [Aspose.Email for Java 6.7.0][2].

## Capability to Retain Content-Disposition

The API now retains the content-transfer-encoding strings while loading an email and then saving it back. The provision of this feature makes it possible to keep meta0record data of emails intact while they are processed using the API.

## Provision of Auto Determination of SSL Mode

The SecurityOptions mode offered by the API included None, Auto, SSLImplicit and SSLExplicit options. This month’s release adds another option of SSLAuto to this Enumerator that avoids setting the security options to None while selecting between the two SSL options at the same time.

## Other Improvements

This month’s release also includes all the bug fixes as inherited from its equivalent .NET version. This further adds to the overall stability of the API.
