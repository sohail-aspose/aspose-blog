[![Aspose.Cells logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/05/aspose.cells-logo2.jpg)We’re pleased to share the announcement of Aspose.Cells for .NET 7.2.2. We have added a new feature, disabling Microsoft Excel’s Compatibility Checker in this release. We have also added support for adding quotes around your data when saving to CSV format, as one of our customers asked us to. We have added some other useful enhancements around the Subtotals feature. The XML Map properties will now be retained when re-saving the template file. We have also improved the Formula Calculation Engine and Pivot Table rendering features and fixed a few issues they had. The Excel-to-PDF feature is further improved for shapes rendering.

We also fixed some bugs in the web based Grid control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET.

To see a complete list of enhancements and fixes and to download Aspose.Cells for .NET 7.2.2, please [visit the download page][2].
