[![Aspose.Email for Java][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/02/aspose.email-logo120.jpg)

Aspose.Email for Java 2.5.0 has been released.  With the release of this version, PST contents can now be saved to a memory stream (see: PST to Stream) by enumerating MessageInfo or message Entry IDs.  Earlier, message extraction from PST files followed the extraction of MessageInfo first and then retrieved the complete message based on information from the MessageInfo objects for saving to stream.

This month's release also includes some important bug fixes related to PST messages' Recipients fields and EML's charset support. To get further details about what's new & fixed, read the release notes on the [Aspose.Email for Java][2] release page.
