Aspose.Email for Java includes classes that allow you to create as well as read message files, enabling complete processing of message contents. Now, you can use these classes to create, edit and convert email message formats such as MSG, EML, EMLX, and MHT in Python without the need of using Microsoft Outlook. You can not only modify the message contents but also manipulate (add/remove) message attachments in Python. It provides you with sufficient ability to customize message headers in Python and also empowers you to completely control a message by exposing its Mapi properties.
