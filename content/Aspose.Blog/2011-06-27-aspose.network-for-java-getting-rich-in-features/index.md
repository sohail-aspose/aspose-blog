Aspose.Email for Java was first released in July 2010 with Microsoft MSG file format support. It's been a year and we are continuously working on adding new features in it to make it more closer to the Aspose.Network for .NET.

Recently, we released Aspose.Network for Java 2.1, which can now handle EML, MSG and MHTML files. You can create new message, load existing message, do changes and save to disk, convert from one format to another, read attachments etc. For getting started, you may have a look at the samples included in the downloaded zip file read this article in our online documentation.
