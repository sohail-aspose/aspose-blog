Many great things in the world are the result of merging. Nature, animals, people, and technology merge together to produce unmatchable results.

At Aspose we merge templates to produce robust documents. HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and XML and JSON are data sources for storing and transporting user data. By merging HTML with the user data source, you can get highly effective dynamic HTML documents.

Using **Aspose.HTML** **for .NET** you can create **HTML Templates** and **Merge** them with data sources using [ConvertTemplate][1] method in a single line of code.

```
ConvertTemplate(HTMLDocument, TemplateData, TemplateLoadOptions, outputPath)
```

## HTML Template

You can create a simple HTML template for working with user data:

{{< gist aspose-com-gists f3606888162b6b9cad4e80c485ee4ec3 "HTMLTemplate.html" >}}

## JSON Data

For the given HTML template you can have the following JSON data:

{{< gist aspose-com-gists f3606888162b6b9cad4e80c485ee4ec3 "SampleJson.json" >}}

## Output

By merging the given JSON and HTML using Aspose.HTML for .NET, you'll have the following resultant HTML file:

{{< gist aspose-com-gists f3606888162b6b9cad4e80c485ee4ec3 "MergeHTMLwithJson.html" >}}
