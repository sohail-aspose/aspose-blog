We like to share the announcement of new release, [Aspose.Slides for .NET][1] 8.0.0. This is primarily a maintenance release where the focus has been resolving rendering issues. We have introduced a new feature for replacing the image in the Presentation class's PictureCollection. Now, one can replace the selected image in a PictureCollection. All the shapes in the presentation that use the selected image are automatically updated to use the new image. For more details about this feature, please visit this documentation link.

We have also improved the rendering support by resolving many chart, bullets and text rendering issues encountered during slide thumbnail generation, PDF and HTML exports. We have also rectified presentation access and saving issues in this new release as well.

To see a complete list of fixes and to download Aspose.Slides for .NET 8.0.0, [please visit the download page][2].
