**March 14, 2007 - Sydney, Australia -** Aspose Ltd started trading in 2002. In the last five years the company has come a long way. What started as a Sydney-based team that developed components for .NET developers, has grown to a company with teams in Australia, US, New Zealand, Ukraine, Pakistan and China that deliver high-quality class libraries and components for .NET and Java. Not satisfied with two platforms, Aspose are planning to launch their first rendering extension for SQL Server Reporting Services in the next couple of months.

Talking about Aspose’s early days, Ben Li, Team Leader for the Sydney team, said “_It is great to see how far we have come in the last five years. We had ambitious plans when we started and we are still ambitious, so this is no time to rest._” To go from a small Australian to an international company, the company has had to adapt constantly but it is not all change. “_We still want to deliver the best file management and conversion components on the market. We still want to give our users the best possible technical support. We still want to help developers be more productive and create better solutions for their organizations. That hasn’t changed._” said Ben.

Danny Cooper, the Aspose Texas Team Leader, says: "_I am honored to join the Aspose family, and look forward to helping grow awareness of our file management tools within the development community._" Danny is a software entrepreneur with an established history in technology and promotion.

As Aspose looks ahead to the next five years, the company is sure to continue working to be at the fore-front of the component market. With two ComponentSource Top 100 awards for 2006 in the trophy cabinet, the team is confident that its hard work and attention to detail will continue to give its customers what they want.
