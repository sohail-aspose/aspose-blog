[![Aspose.Email for Java][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/02/aspose.email-logo120.jpg)

We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Email for Java 1.5.0. This monthâ€™s release provides a brand new save format: you can now export any message loaded into Aspose.Email to EMLX. This release also provides the functionality to manipulate IMP.Tasks type contents through MapiTask class. Last but not the least, Aspose.Email for Java 1.5.0 now provides a choice to the user in order to load a PST file. A new overload of the PersonalStorage.fromFile method lets you open a PST in writeable or read-only modes.

Read the [release notes][2] to get a full list of the new features, enhancements and fixes included in Aspose.Email for Java 1.5.0.
