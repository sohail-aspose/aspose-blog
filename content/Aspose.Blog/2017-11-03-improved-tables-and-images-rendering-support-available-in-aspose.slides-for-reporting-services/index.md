We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 17.10.

This release has been developed based on Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.10 Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.10 has some new features including support for adding EMZ images inside presentation along with sub-script and super-script text in presentation. We have also resolved issues related to tables rendering as well in this API. The presentation rendering support has also been improved for text, images and different chart elements. The improved rendering support in Aspose.Slides for .NET will achieve better rendering of SQL Server reports when exporting to PowerPoint or other formats using Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 17.10 Release Notes][1] for further reference.
