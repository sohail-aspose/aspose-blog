We are pleased to share the release announcement for [Aspose.Slides for JasperReports][1] 18.4.

This release has been built on the basis of the latest Aspose.Slides for Java 18.4 API, whereby we have included support for MSO 2016 charts along with improved SVG rendering support that allows exporting individual slide shapes to SVG. We have also addressed the licensing related issues incurring in API as well.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for JasperReports 18.4 Release Notes][2] for further reference.
