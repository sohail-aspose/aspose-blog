Dear Customers

   We have decided to build Aspose.Workflow next major release (CodeName: Aspose.Workflow.WWF) based on Microsoft Windows Workflow Foundation and we will still maintain the old Aspose.Workflow by customer request.  
The first release of Aspose.Workflow.WWF will contains following features:  
1) Develop under .NET 2.0  
2) Based on Microsoft Windows Workflow Foundation  
3) Fully support WFMC specification  
4) Refacted database tables  
5) Backwards compatible with Aspose.Workflow.  
6) Integrated with Visual Studio 2005

The fist release will be ready in early May, we will update the progress at times.

Regards,  
Stone
