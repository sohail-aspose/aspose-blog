This guy Pascal (sorry cannot find any more info) has written an interesting series of articles called Implementing conditional logic for Word documents using Aspose.Words.

Basically, this is a feature we get a lot of requests for and he went out and implemented it himself. We are very impressed with the extent of work he has done. Hats off to Pascal.

This is not the first time a customer implements some required feature before we at Aspose get to implement it. An interesting story can be told about HTML export in Aspose.Words, it was also written by a customer before it was available in Aspose.Words.

When customers choose to spend so much time programming with our component, we really appreciate that. It is a very good sign, it means Aspose.Words is getting accepted by the developer community.

From our side, let me assure you we are doing the best we can to please developers - our users. If there is a feature missing - rest assured, it is coming. We just have a bit too many of requests in the pipeline even after 4+ years of work on Aspose.Words.
