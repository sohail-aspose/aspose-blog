[![][1]](https://products.aspose.com/tasks/net)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET 7.2.0. This month’s release includes a new feature that completely implements code masks for WBS code definition. It always incorporates a number of bug fixes that further improves the overall functionality of the API. Complete details about the new features, enhancements and bug fixes can be found on the [product download page][2]. You may also share your feedback with us by writing in the [Aspose.Tasks forum][3].

## Support for WBS Code Definition

This month’s release provides complete support for code mask in WBS code definition. Earlier, there were many fields to be read and written which is now completed. This feature allows the API to read the code mask associated with the WBS code definitions and write these when saving to an output MPP. This has been achieved by introducing a new public property, WBSCodeDefinition, to the API's Project class.

## Enhanced Data Rendering

This month’s release brings further improvement to the API's data rendering capabilities. Previous versions supported rendering task links across single pages only. This has been now enhanced so that task links such as FS, SS, FF, and SF are rendered across horizontal as well as vertical pages.

## Other Improvements

This month’s release also fixes a number of bugs and exceptions that were reported by our customers. These include:

*   Recalculation errors while calculating values of max. units, w.comp and overallocations.
*   Rendering collapsed sub tasks as expanded.
*   Unassigned resource rendered at the top.
*   Text alignment disturbance.
