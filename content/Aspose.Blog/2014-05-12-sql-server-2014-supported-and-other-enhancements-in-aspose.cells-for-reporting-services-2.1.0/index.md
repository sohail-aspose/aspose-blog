[![Aspose.Cells for SSRS icon][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Cells-for-SSRS-e1377591440623.png)We are happy to announce the release of Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services 2.1.0. In this release, we have optimized the overall performance of Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services, enhanced the performance when rendering and exporting Microsoft Excel files and fixed a few issues occurring when exporting reports.

## Support for SQL Server 2014

Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services has increased its productivity since it can now be used with SQL Server 2014. Developers and administrators can easily design, develop, maintain and export reports. Please see the System Requirements page for your reference.

## Several Enhancements and Fixes

We have enhanced the performance when exporting reports with large data sets. We have fixed an issue regarding rendering reports. The issue occurred when the report was exported using the **Save** option provided on the report interface. The report exported fine for smaller datasets but failed with large datasets where it gave an error. In the latest release, we have also figured out an issue with grouping and merging data. Moreover we made lots of improvement regarding Microsoft Excel 2007/2010 file formats and conversions in the new version.
