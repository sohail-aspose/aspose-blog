We have released Aspose.Cells for Java 7.0.3. This version comes with some important enhancements. You can now save XLS and XLSX files in Light Cells mode using LightCellsDataProvider. This gives you better performance for bigger files.

We have improved the Excel-to-PDF conversion feature. Follow the link to read about the updated feature in the documentation.

One of our users reported a clash between Aspose.Cells for Java and other JARs that they were using (specifically woodstoxs-core and webservices-rt). We have resolved that issue and this release makes the fix available to all of our users.

We've also added  a method for getting a list of colors for different objects used in a worksheet. This was requested by a customer last month and it was a very good suggestion. Now, all our users have access to this feature.

There are over 20 fixes and enhancements included in this release.
