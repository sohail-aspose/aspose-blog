**[![A cup for our 10,000th customer][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2011/08/10K_cup.png)Sydney, Australia – 1 October, 2011 –** Last year, Aspose’s file format community reached 100,000 members. This year, we celebrate our 10,000th customer. The company has been operating for nine years and has achieved a lot in that time: it has teams in several countries, has developed many new products, supports five different platforms and has introduced a number of new services. Reaching 10,000 customers is another important mile stone.

To celebrate reaching such a significant number of customers, [Aspose announced that they were giving a price to the 10,000th customer][2] in ﻿August 2011. The announcement also offered 25% discount on Aspose.Total.

# Customer number 10,000

Joel Heinrich works for [M-Files][3] in Finland. M-Files deliver document management solutions for businesses. They help small to medium businesses improve their efficiency and productivity by improving how they organize and manage business documents, information and processes.

M-Files first investigated Aspose.Words when Joel Heinrich was investigating tools for changing meta tags without having to open a file. The extended capabilities of Aspose.Words really impressed him and, he explains "_I realized it also fulfilled many other functions that our customers and staff had been asking for. The biggest requirement was conversion of Word documents to PDF.  Aspose's rendering quality  and ease of use in this area is a huge benefit to us and our clients. It puts our previous attempts at Word and OpenOffice automation _to shame_. It's really too bad M-Files didn't find Aspose years ago!_"

The reason that M-Files invested in Aspose.Total was not meta tags but quality management. Joel Heinrich and his colleagues are developing a Quality Management System that is built on top of the existing platform. The system combines tools, processes, workflows and templates, and allows companies to use an effective electronic process that complies with their regulations. M-Files can already use Aspose.Words to add electronic signatures and watermarks to documents: with Aspose.Total they can extend this functionality to many other formats. PDF is a priority.

We hope Joel Heinrich will enjoy his MacBook Air and developer license for Aspose.Total.
