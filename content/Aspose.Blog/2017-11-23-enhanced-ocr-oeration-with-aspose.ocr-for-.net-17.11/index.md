Aspose.OCR for .NET 17.11 is now available for [public use][1]. This is primarily a maintenance release whereby we have resolved certain issues incurring in API. Furthermore, the overall performance of the API has also been improved in this release.

## Other Improvements

The following is the list of improvements made in this release.

*   Binary Classification has been introduced for better OCR recognition.
*   OCR network implemented in Player under our main OCR component to achieve better performance.

Since all the enhancements are internal to the API, there are no public API changes from the end user's point of view and the features can be used readily with this new version.

Please check the release notes of [Aspose.OCR for .Net 17.11][2] for a complete list of enhancements. You can access the latest version from [NuGet][3].
