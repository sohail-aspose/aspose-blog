![Aspose.Pdf icon][1]

We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Pdf for Java 3.3.0][2] which provides a better and enhanced XML to PDF conversion feature. In this release, the image transformation engine has been rewritten and is based on ImageIO. The main benefit of the new engine is better support for different image formats and from nowÂ on, Aspose.Pdf for Java should work faster due to optimised operations with images.

Besides this, we also have resolved the issues related to image to PDF conversion and XML transformation to PDF format. Please visit the following link for further details on what's new & fixed in [Aspose.Pdf for Java 3.3.0][3].
