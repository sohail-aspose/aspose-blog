[Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET][1] 5.7.0 has been released with some improvements. In this version, we have enhanced features like adding image, extracting text, setting form field attributes, importing and exporting annotations, filling image field and adding multiline text in a text box.

You may download the latest version from the [Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET downloads section][2]. However, I would like to share with you that we have also released merged Aspose.Pdf for .NET. This merged version contains the features of Aspose.Pdf for .NET and Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET; it also contains a new DOM API. Moreover, we will discontinue Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET from October 2011. So, I would encourage you to migrate to the new merged Aspose.Pdf for .NET. You may find some related posts on this link.
