## OpenXML SDK

Office Open XML, also known as OpenXML or OOXML, is an XML-based format for office documents, including word processing documents, spreadsheets and presentations. The OpenXML SDK for Microsoft Office simplifies the task of manipulating Open XML packages and the underlying Open XML schema elements within a package. The classes in the Open XML SDK encapsulate many common tasks that developers perform on Open XML packages, so that you can perform complex operations with lines of code.

## Aspose for .NET APIs

[![Aspose.Total for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/01/aspose_total-for-net.jpg)Aspose.Total for .NET is a compilation of every .NET API offered by Aspose. Using Aspose.Total for .NET developers can create a wide range of applications, each leveraging the combined power of Aspose for .NET.

Aspose's APIs are designed with the philosophy of allowing developers to accomplish tasks with the least amount of work and supports a number of file formats including legacy and OpenXML Microsoft Office file formats. For more information about the Aspose for .NET APIs, please visit [Aspose.Total for .NET][2].

For more detailed comparison between Aspose for .NET and OpenXML SDK, please check Why Not Open XML SDK. Furthermore, the Aspose for .NET APIs support OpenOffice, PDF, image and more file formats as well as Microsoft Office file formats.

## Aspose for OpenXML SDK

Aspose for OpenXML SDK is a project that provides source code examples for achieving tasks using OpenXML and the Aspose for .NET APIs side by side. The project has been hosted on [BitBucket][3] and [CodePlex][4]. The initial version of this project provides a few comparative source code examples. We'll add more examples in the next iterations so developers can save time and quickly try Aspose and OpenXML. Additionally, these examples are helpful to anyone who is migrating from OpenXML SDK to Aspose. Below is an outline of this project:

*   [Aspose.Words vs OpenXML Word][5] ([Bitbucket variant][6]
*   [Aspose.Cells vs OpenXML Spreadsheet][7] ([Bitbucket variant][8]
*   [Aspose.Slides vs OpenXML Presentation][9] ([Bitbucket variant][10]

You can download the project from your favorite social coding web site and extract it. Use Visual Studio to open the project and run it. Each solution contains two projects.

*   **Aspose:** Explains how the same functionality is performed using Aspose.
