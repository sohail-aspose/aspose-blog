[PUB][1] files are usually used to create or edit the publications. Pamphlets, brochures, visiting cards, and many other types of files are created in Microsoft Publisher application thus saved as the file extension .pub. However, because of the popularity and support of PDF format, you may need to convert PUB to PDF. For such scenarios, Aspose.PUB for C++ API is the answer to your requirements.

## C++ PUB to PDF Converter API

Looking at the background information about the API, previously only [Aspose.PUB for .NET][2] API was available so one could use that with C# or VB.NET programming language. However, the increasing and repeating requests for supporting the C++ platform resulted in the conception of [Aspose.PUB for C++][3] API. Now you can edit, manipulate, and convert PUB files in your C++ applications.

## Installation

The API is available at the [Downloads][4] section as well as on the [NuGet][5] gallery. Where you can simply run the following command or install using NuGet Manager for Solution, in Visual Studio IDE.

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.PUB.Cpp
