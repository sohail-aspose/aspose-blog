Dear Customers,

Thanks for considering Aspose.

It is to announce that Aspose.Total Wiki is updated to have the following features:

*   Wiki contents are managed in an easier manner to help customers in navigating through wiki topics with greater flexibility.
*   Each demo is divided into its **Functional** & **Technical** Details.
*   All functional detail pages are supplied with rich screenshots and easy descriptions that would help customers to understandÂ the functionality of demos easily.
*   **Two new demos:** **Invoice Creator** and **Flash Creator** are also added with their functional and technical details.

Moreover, Aspose.Total Demos are also available to [download][1] in both CS and VB.NET versions with some minor changes. The demos are packaged in the form of Windows Installers. All you need is to run the installer and Aspose.Total demos will be installed on your system for your evaluation.

Aspose.Total Wiki and Demos are brought to you by Aspose.Service Team. Please feel free to Contact Us to get benefits from our Services.
