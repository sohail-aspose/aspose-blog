Dear Customers,  

Thanks for considering Aspose.  

We have released a new version (1.3) of Aspose.Total Northwind Demos. The change summary for this release is described below:  

**Change Summary**

*   **Email Demo Application (Email.aspx)** is almost re-created with the latest version of Aspose.Network (3.0.0.0). In this demo, **Use Default SMTP Settings** feature is added to make it quick for users to use the demo. **File Attachments** feature is optimized according to latest release of Aspose.Network. **FreeTextBox** is used instead of a simple **TextArea** for typing email message. Using **FreeTextBox** control, now users can create and send **Html** emails containing more rich content. **Spell Check** feature is enabled in **FreeTextBox** control to help users in checking spells of their email message. An exciting feature added to this demo is the support of **EML** files that is the feature of latest version of Aspose.Network. Now, users cannot only open an existing **EML** file using **Open** button of **FreeTextBox** control but also **Save** and download their email message as an **EML** file by clicking the **Save** button of **FreeTextBox**. This **Email Demo** is also integrated with other demos of Aspose.Total for providing emailing feature.
*   **Default Page of Aspose.Total Demos (Default.aspx)** is modified to contain an updated description of **Email Demo Application**.
*   **Open File Dialog (OpenFile.aspx)** is modified to accomodate opening **EML** files feature in **Email Demo Application**.
*   **Save File Dialog (SaveFile.aspx)** is modified to accomodate saving **EML** files feature in **Email Demo Application**.
*   **Spell Checker Dialog (SpellChecker.aspx)** got a little fluke that is also fixed.
