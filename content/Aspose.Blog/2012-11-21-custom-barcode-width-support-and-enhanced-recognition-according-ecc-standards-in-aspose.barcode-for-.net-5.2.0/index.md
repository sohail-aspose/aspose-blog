[![Aspose.BarCode logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/04/aspose.barcode-logo2.jpg)Aspose.BarCode for .NET 5.2.0 has been released. We are pleased to announce that from this version you can [generate and recognize barcodes with custom width][2]. This release also includes the most recent bug fixes and enhanced recognition according to the ECC standards. We've added error correction so that barcodes can be recognized even if they are partially damaged.

The Aspose.BarCode for .NET API provides the handy [BarCodeBuilder.GetOnlyBarCodeImage][3] method whose overloads allow you to get a bitmap image with a barcode. You can also choose theÂ [GetCustomSizeBarCodeImage method][4] which allows you set the size for a whole picture with a barcode in it.

To view a complete list of new features and fixes and to download the new release of Aspose.BarCode for .NET, [please visit the download page][5].
