[![User group][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/)Software engineering and IT administration are jobs that doesn't allow you to depend on old knowledge. Professionals have to keep up to stay current. That's why Aspose are committed to supporting user groups across the globe. User groups, and the events they arrange, helps software professionals get together and learn about technologies and industry changes, track trends and keep up with what's new. User groups let experienced processionals share and hone their skills, and gives students and practitioners in their first job a chance to meet peers at a variety of experience levels.

## BIWUG SharePoint Saturday

On April 27, 2013, [BIWUG][2], the Belux Information Worker User Group, is running a SharePoint Saturday (SPSBE). SharePoint Saturdays are fee events that bring together professionals who want to learn about SharePoint. [BIWUG's SharePoint Saturday][3] runs nine tracks over five sessions so there's something for any SharePoint professional. SPSBE is the third SharePoint Saturday run by BIWUG and, by the time of writing, tickets have already sold out. It's going to be a busy event.

## Supporting User Groups Worldwide

In the past, Aspose has sponsored a number of user groups in the Americas. We continue to support groups there, and are working with groups in Europa and Asia to make sure that we support established and emerging professionals everywhere. Regardless of where they work, IT professionals and developers have to keep their skills current. In recent months, we've sponsored events in India, Germany and Italy, as well as USA. If you have a user group, or know of a group or conference, that could benefit from our support, let us know. [Find out more about how we support the community][4].
