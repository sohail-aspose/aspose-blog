## C++ API for Working with Comments in Word Documents {#CPP-API-for-Working-with-Comments-in-Word-Documents}

[Aspose.Words for C++][6] is a native C++ library that allows you to create, read, modify and convert Microsoft Word documents. In addition, it also supports working with comments in [DOCX][7] and [DOC][8] files. You can either install the API through [NuGet][9] or download it directly from the [Downloads][10] section.

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.Words.Cpp
```

## Add Comments to Word Documents using C++ {#Add-Comments-to-Word-Documents-using-CPP}

Aspose.Words for C++ API provides the ability to add comments with the author name, initials, and date/time. The following are the steps to add comments to Word documents.

*   Firstly, load the Word document using the [Document][11] class.
*   Create an instance of the [DocumentBuilder][12] class by passing the [Document][13] object created in the previous step.
*   Create the comment using the [Comment][14] class.
*   Add the comment to the document using the [DocumentBuilder->get\_CurrentParagraph()->AppendChild(System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Node> newChild)][15] method.
*   Finally, save the document using the [Document->Save(System::String fileName)][16] method.

The following sample code demonstrates how to add comments to Word documents using C++.

## Read Comments from a Word Document {#Read-Comments-from-a-Word-Document}

The following are the steps to read comments from Word documents.

*   Load the Word document using the [Document][17] class.
*   Retrieve the comments using the [Document->GetChildNodes(Aspose::Words::NodeType nodeType, bool isDeep)][18] method.
*   Iterate through the comments and retrieve the information of individual comments.

The following is the sample code to read comments from a Word document using C++.

{{< gist aspose-com-gists efb4e75bba0cdfe538fc9c701bc804af "Read-Comments.cpp" >}}

## Modify Comments in a Word Document using C++ {#Modify-Comments-in-a-Word-Document-using-CPP}

In order to modify a comment, retrieve it using the [NodeCollection->idx\_get(int32\_t index)][19] method and change it according to your needs. The following are the steps to modify comments in a Word document.

*   Firstly, load the Word document using the [Document][20] class.
*   Retrieve the comments using the [Document->GetChildNodes(Aspose::Words::NodeType nodeType, bool isDeep)][21] method.
*   Get the desired comment using the [NodeCollection->idx\_get(int32\_t index)][22] method and casting the result to [Comment][23].
*   Update the comment.
*   Finally, save the document using the [Document->Save(System::String fileName)][24] method.

The following sample code shows how to modify comments in a Word document using C++.

*   [Delete All Comments][27]

### Delete a Specific Comment {#Delete-a-Specific-Comment}

The following are the steps to delete a specific comment.

*   Load the Word document using the [Document][28] class.
*   Retrieve the comments using the [Document->GetChildNodes(Aspose::Words::NodeType nodeType, bool isDeep)][29] method.
*   Get the comment you want to delete using the [NodeCollection->idx\_get(int32\_t index)][30] method and casting the result to [Comment][31].
*   Delete the comment using the [Comment->Remove()][32] method.
*   Save the document using the [Document->Save(System::String fileName)][33] method.

The following sample code shows how to delete a specific comment from a Word document using C++.

### Deleting Comments by Author {#Deleting-Comments-by-Author}

The following are the steps to delete comments by author.

*   Firstly, load the Word document using the [Document][34] class.
*   Retrieve the comments using the [Document->GetChildNodes(Aspose::Words::NodeType nodeType, bool isDeep)][35] method.
*   Loop through the comments.
*   Within the loop, retrieve the comment and compare its author. If the author matches, delete the comment.
*   Finally, save the document using the [Document->Save(System::String fileName)][36] method.

The following is the sample code to delete comments by author using C++.

{{< gist aspose-com-gists efb4e75bba0cdfe538fc9c701bc804af "Delete-Comments-By-Author.cpp" >}}

### Delete All Comments {#Delete-All-Comments}

Instead of deleting individual comments, you can delete all the comments at once using the [NodeCollection->Clear()][37] method. The following are the steps to delete all comments from a Word document.

*   Load the Word document using the [Document][38] class.
*   Retrieve the comments using the [Document->GetChildNodes(Aspose::Words::NodeType nodeType, bool isDeep)][39] method.
*   Remove all the comments using the [NodeCollection->Clear()][40] method.
*   Finally, save the document using the [Document->Save(System::String fileName)][41] method.

The following sample code demonstrates how to delete all the comments from a Word document using C++.
