We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET 7.3.0. This month’s release is sort of a maintenance release that fixes a number of bugs reported by our valued users. These bring further stability to the existing functionality of the API. You may visit our [product download page][2] to get detailed information about these issues. The public API changes in Aspose.Tasks for .NET 7.3.0 lists all the changes incurred in this month’s release.

# Improvements

Following is the list of all the issues that have been fixed in this month’s release.

**Rendering issues:** During the past few months, we had introduced a new feature of retaining the same project data view while rendering data to various formats. This feature was supported for Task Sheet, Task Usage, Resource and Resource Usage views. This month’s release brings further stability to this feature by fixing issues such as text alignment, changes in resource names, missing columns in output and change in table contents during rendering of Project data to PDF.

**Calendar Association with a Task:** Aspose.Tasks API already provides the capability to define and associate a calendar with a Task. This month’s release fixes a bug that was found while attaching a new calendar to a Task which could further effect the calculations. This, in turn, further enhances the API functionality in terms of reliability.

**Implementation of More MPP Writing Features:** At present, our development team is trying its best to extend the range of MPP writing functionality supported by the API.  At the same time, we are trying hard to make the API easier to understand and its use in applications. Please stay tuned for further updates in this regard.
