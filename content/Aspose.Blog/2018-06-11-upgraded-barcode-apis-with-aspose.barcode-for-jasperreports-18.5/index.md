 [![Aspose.BarCode for JasperReports][1]](https://products.aspose.com/barcode/jasperreports) We are pleased to announce new Aspose.BarCode for JasperReports 18.5 release.

This release has been developed based on Aspose.BarCode for Java 18.5, whereby we have fixed the issues in the API and removed functionality which were marked as obsolete. **GetCustomSizeBarCodeImage** method was not working properly. It was discarding the check digit in the image generated by Aspose.BarCode. This issue has been rectified. Further, it was found that an incorrect/fake **MicrE13B** barcode detected by the API. This issue has also been taken care.

To view a complete list of fixes, please visit [Aspose.Barcode for JasperReport 18.5 release notes][2] page.
