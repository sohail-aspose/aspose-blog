**GeekOut** is a Java Technology Conference that was started as a single day event by ZeroTurnaround in 2011. It has grown into a full-blown, two day show for developers. The focus of the conference is on Java, the JVM, covering developer tooling, solution architecture, programming methodologies, continuous delivery and programming languages for the JVM platform. GeekOut focuses on ideas and communication - rather than on the quantity of talks and pitches. Our speakers, partners and exhibitors are hand picked based on their technology and contribution to the java community.
