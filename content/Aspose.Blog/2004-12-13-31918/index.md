We know how confusing it can be trying to learn how different companies handle different issues; therefore, Aspose has now created a Business Policy section in order to provide all of that information in one convenient spot.  The new Aspose Business Policy section covers Updates, Upgrades, Support and many other issues.  As Aspose adds or changes policies, this will be the place to find them.  If there are other things that we can be doing to make business with Aspose easier, please feel free to send you suggestions to me at [Danny.Cooper@aspose.com][1] …
