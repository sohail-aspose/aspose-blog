We have released Aspose.Cells for JasperReports v1.0.0 for the users.

In this version, we have supported different types of charts including bar, area, pie, line etc. The charts in the exported report(s) can be edited in MS Excel with ease. The component integrates with JasperServer and also eliminates the dependency of POI library.
