We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for JasperReports 17.5.

This release has been built on the basis of latest Aspose.Slides for Java 17.5 API. Aspose.Slides for Java 17.5 is enriched with some new features including addition of HeaderFooterManager class for slides, layout slides and Master slides. This will help to set the headers and footers properties on individual slides level. The presentation rendering support has also been improved for text, images and different chart elements.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for JasperReports 17.5 Release Notes][2] for further reference.
