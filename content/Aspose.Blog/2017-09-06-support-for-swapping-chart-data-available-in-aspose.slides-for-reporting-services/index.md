We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 17.8.

This release has been developed based on Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.8. Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.8 has some new features including support for managing embedded fonts and swapping chart data. Moreover, the support for stretching added image for shapes and Notes slide style has been included in API. The presentation rendering support has also been improved for text, images and different chart elements. The improved rendering support in Aspose.Slides for .NET will achieve better rendering of SQL Server reports when exporting to PowerPoint or other formats using Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 17.8 Release Notes][1] for further reference.
