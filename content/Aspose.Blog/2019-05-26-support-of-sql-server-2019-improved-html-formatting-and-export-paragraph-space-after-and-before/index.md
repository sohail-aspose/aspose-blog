The wait is over guys! We are pleased to announce the new release of [Aspose.Words for Reporting Services 19.2][1]. We added support of SQL Server 2019 in this release and upgraded it to Aspose.Words for .NET 19.2. Now, you can export RDL/RDLC to DOCX, DOC, TXT, etc. within Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services 2019.

Moreover, we added another feature to export the space after/before the properties of the paragraph in the output Word document. Last but not least, the export of HTML formatting within SQL Server Reporting Services 2005 was improved.
