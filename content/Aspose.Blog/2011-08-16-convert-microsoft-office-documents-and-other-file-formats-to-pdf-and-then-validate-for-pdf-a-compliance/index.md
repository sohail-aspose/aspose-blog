## About PDF

[PDF][1] (Portable Document Format) is an open standard for document exchange created by Adobe Systems. This file format is supported by a wide variety of platforms. The PDF format is now commonly used in a large number of fields to store and exchange information. As PDF format has become an open standard and it is widely supported, it is preferred for data exchange. That's why various file formats need to be converted to PDF so that the data can be viewed on different operating systems installed on various types of hardware.
