We like to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for Java 7.3.0.

In this new release we have introduced the long awaited feature of linked OLE frames. Please visit this link for your further information. We have also improved the performance of Aspose.Slides for Java in terms of rendering to PDF and thumbnail generation. Some presentation cloning issues have also been addressed in this new release alongside presentation corruption issues.

To see a complete list of fixes and to download Aspose.Slides for Java 7.3.0, please visit the [download page][2].
