## SVG to PDF or XPS Converter – API Installation {#section1}

[Aspose.SVG for .NET][10] is a dedicated product to edit, manipulate, or convert SVG files. We have designed it while considering a huge number of feature requests from the users. You can easily install the API by using NuGet from the Tools menu in Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. This approach can be helpful in the way that all dependencies are automatically installed with the single installation command. For instance, SVG rendering might also need System.Drawing reference which is not often available by default, in non-windows environments. Moreover, you can also download the API from the [official website][11].
