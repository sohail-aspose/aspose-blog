We were happy to find a bunch of great Aspose.Words testimonials at [411ASP.NET][1] recently. Apparently, our marketing team knows this place (since Aspose has an advert there), but we, the development team came across it first time and it was a big pleasure to read. There is also a separate topic in the Support Forums for testimonials.

Remember you are always welcome to post, it does make difference to us. Positive and constructive is appreciated and leads to a better product.
