We’re pleased to announce that the [new version 16.11.0 of Aspose.Diagram for Java API][1] is now live. This new version of the API has come with improved performance along with new features. It allows developers to insert a text shape anywhere in the Visio drawing. Developers can also retrieve ActiveX controls, like command button, combo box, checkbox, list box, textbox, spin button, radio button, label, image, toggle button and scrollbar from a Visio drawing, and then change their properties. Developers would also notice an improvement in converting VSD diagrams to PDFs. We recommend our clients [use the powerful Aspose for Java APIs directly in their Maven Projects with simple configurations][2]. For details on API fixes, please visit the product [Release Notes][3] section of this new version.

## Insert a Text Shape in the Visio Drawing

There is no way to add text directly in the Visio drawing. Users can add text through creating the text shapes like on the **Home** tab, under **Tools** group, click “A Text” button, and then draw in the Visio drawing. Developers can add this feature in their project applications using Aspose.Diagram API. From now onward, they may not add any alternative shapes from the stencil files. This help topic shows how to insert a text shape in the Visio page: [Insert a Text Shape in the Visio Page][4]

## Modify the Properties of an ActiveX Control in Visio

The last two API versions (6.8.0 and 16.10.0) have support of adding an ActiveX control in the Visio drawing. Developers were not able to retrieve an ActiveX control from an existing Visio drawing to modify it. Using this new API version, they can retrieve a Visio shape as usual like in the earlier versions, additionally can retrieve an ActiveX control from a Visio shape object, and then modify its properties. This help topic shows a code example to achieve this: [Retrieve an ActiveX Control from a Shape Object to Modify Properties][5]

We auto port Aspose.Diagram for .NET to Java to give developers perfectly the same features on both platforms, so this version incorporates the bug fixes and enhancements from its equivalent .NET version. Please check a list of the resolved defects:

*   Fixed: Can't set the width and height of an ActiveX button in the VSDM.
*   Fixed: VSD to VDX conversion, an invalid resultant file is created.
*   Fixed: VSDX to PDF export - Solid lines of shapes are converted to dashed lines.
*   Fixed: A black strip comes in place of the text on converting a VSD page to PNG.
*   Fixed: A black stripe appears in place of the top right corner text on converting a VSD page to PNG.
*   Fixed: The menu icons are not properly visible on converting Visio pages to SVGs.
*   Fixed: The black strips appear in place of the Form's text items on converting Visio pages to SVGs.
*   Fixed: Shapes become invisible on grouping and saving in VSDM.
*   Fixed: Missing shapes on converting a VST to PDF.
*   Fixed: The background color of the page is not being preserved on converting a VSD to SVG.
*   Fixed: Open and Save VSDX - the cross signs appear in place various shapes.
*   Fixed: Open and save VSDX - the text of the shape turns into dummy characters.
*   Fixed: Can't add shape menu item (action).
