We went with friends for a bit of surfing at Piha a week ago. It is a great place, not only for surfing, just a great place. A few more friends joined us later on and we went for a walk to see the rocks and waves. Two of them went pretty close to the waves, dangerous stuff.

There are always reports of fishermen being swept to the sea from those rocks.Â But they went anyway. I was filming two fishermen that were coming up when a good sized wave struck and you will see after the camera moves the two guys get a good wash.

Search for Piha on Youtube.com, there are few more clips by others.
