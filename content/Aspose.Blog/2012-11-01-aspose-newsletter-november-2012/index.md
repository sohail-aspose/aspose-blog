## Spotlight on File Conversion

Last month, we launched Aspose.Imaging for Java with a newsletter themed around working with images. This month, our theme is file conversion.

File conversion is only one of the many tasks our tools can help developers perform, but it is an important one. Do you need to process forms submitted as Microsoft Word documents, extract data and archive the original document as a PDF, complete with a barcode for tracking? Or maybe build flexible slide stacks for Microsoft PowerPoint presentations? Do you create management reports by extracting data from databases, performing calculations in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and posting charts on an intranet? Aspose can help developers with all of these tasks. Our customers use Aspose products for all kinds of complex tasks. More often than not, file conversion plays a part. We hope the examples and tips below are useful to you.

Thank you for reading,

### Migration Tip – Create Microsoft Outlook Contacts with Aspose.Email for .NET or Office Automation

[![Migration tip icon][8]](https://blog.aspose.com/)Microsoft Outlook is used for more than sending and receiving emails: it is a powerful tool for organizing contacts and meetings. When a developer wants to create contact programmatically, they can do so using Microsoft Office Automation or Aspose.Email for .NET. The latter is independent of Office Automation and does not require Microsoft Outlook to be installed on the machine. This article compares the two methods. [Read the migration tip][9].
