[![Aspose.Diagram for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/06/aspose-Diagram-for-net_100.png)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Diagram for .NET 3.6.0. This release includes new features and improves Microsoft Visio drawing loading and rendering for image file formats and HTML, especially with German operating systems. The overall drawings loading mechanism is greatly improved.

The following modifications in the new version are also worth noting:

*   This release supports adding a master by reading a stencil file from disk into the stream. In previous versions, Aspose.Diagram adds a master only by name or ID and its stencil file path. You can find the details of this enhancement in the following help topic: Add Master from the Stencil of Shapes.
    
*   We've added the AddComment method. While you add comments to a page, you can place a comment anywhere on the page. The method takes X and Y coordinates along with comment text. You can find the details of this feature in the following help topic: Add Comments to Visio Drawings.
    
*   The SetAngle method has also been added. It allows rotating a shape relative to the page. You can now add lots of shapes on a page with rotating arbitrary angles. You can find the details of this feature in the following help topic: Rotate a Shape with Suitable Angle.
    

With this new version, no additional blank lines are output when loading Visio drawings. The diagram loading improvements also help avoid various exception messages.
