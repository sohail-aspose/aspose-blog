In the month of July-2017, we have published [Aspose.HTML for .NET][1] which offers the capabilities to create as well as manipulate HTML documents in .NET based applications. In order to provide similar features for our customers developing applications on the Java platform, we are going to port the features of current Aspose.HTML for .NET to a new sibling, Aspose.HTML for Java.

## Java HTML API

The earlier released **Aspose.HTML for .NET** is a .NET component built to enable developers to programmatically create and manipulate HTML documents, whether simple or complex and on the fly and now all of these features will become available in Aspose.HTML for Java. Furthermore, the Java HTML API allows developers to insert, remove, and replace HTML nodes as well as extract CSS style information, navigate through HTML document either by elements, document, XPath or CSS selector queries. This new API will also offer the scripting which allows the manipulation of HTML DOM via JavaScript. Nevertheless, this API will also provide the capabilities to load EPUB or MHTML files to perform variant operations.

## Convert HTML to Other Formats in Java

Aspose is among the pioneers to provide the file format manipulation capabilities and our APIs are widely known for their interfile format conversion features. So keeping the tradition alive, this new API will also provide the capabilities to load HTML file and render the output in PDF, XPS and raster image formats including JPEG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF. Apart from simple conversion to PDF format, you may also consider encrypting the resultant document or specify the page setup information for resultant output. You also get the leverage to specify the compression value for JPEG images in the resultant file.

## A lightweight HTML API for Java

Aspose.Html is a simple Application Programming Interface (API) that is easy to learn and use. This API is implemented using the Java platform and it can be used in any Java-based application. This API can be easily integrated with any kind of application either it is a JSP Web Application or a conventional Desktop Application. After the release of the first version, we will be providing fully-featured demos and working examples, developed using Java language. These demos will surely help our customers/developers to quickly learn and use the features provided by Aspose.Html for Java. However, as a jump start, we will be providing a Programmers Guide in our documentation section which can help our customers to learn and start using the API.

The API is a fast, lightweight component with a target to efficiently create and manipulate HTML documents. We are sure this API will become your first choice when it comes to HTML file creation as well as manipulation because of its price, superb performance and great support. Aspose.Html for Java is also multi-thread safe; as long as only one thread works on a single document at a time as it is a usual scenario to have one thread working on one document. Please note that different threads can safely work on different documents at the same time.

## Features List

Aspose.Html for Java API mimics the behavior of a headless browser and offers the following features.

*   Creating or opening an existing HTML document from different sources
*   HTML Manipulation: creating, editing, removing and replacing HTML nodes via API
*   Extracting CSS styles for particular HTML node
*   Configuring a document sandbox that affects the processing of HTML documents i.e. CSS styles in some cases are dependent on screen size and we allow to configure environment independently of an execution machine (as per [W3 specifications][2]
*   Navigation through HTML document in different ways
    *   [Using Element Level Traversal][3]
    *   [Using Document Traversal][4]
    *   [Using XPath queries][5]
    *   [Using CSS Selector queries][6]

*   Scripting that allows manipulating HTML DOM via JavaScript
*   Converting HTML document into various supported formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF
*   Converting (X)HTML and similar formats, such as ePub and MHTML to above-supported formats

Last but not the least, the API is planned to release within the current month and as soon as it becomes available, we will announce it through another blog post. the customers will also be notified through the monthly newsletter. As per our standard cataloging mechanism, it will also become part of Aspose.Total for Java and Aspose.Html product family packages.
