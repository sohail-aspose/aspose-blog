[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-Java_100.png) We're pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for Java 15.2.0. This is one of maintenance release in which we have resolved certain issues incurring in the product.

## New Features

We have introduced the support for setting the automatic fill color for chart series based on presentation theme. Now, users will donâ€™t have to bother for setting the individual series colors. The more details about the supported feature are available in the article Setting Automatic Series Fill Color. We have also provided the support for verifying the presentation file format without even loading that using Aspose.Slides **Presentation** class object that actually loads the entire presentation and then tells its format description. The **PresentationFactory** class now offers the support to get the valid presentation file format before loading that. The more details about the feature are available in article Verifying the presentation file without even loading.

## Resolved Issues

We have improved the presentation rendering support and have resolved certain rendering issues incurring during generation of slide thumbnails, exported PDF, Tiff, SVG and XPS files in Windows, Linux\\Unix and MAC platforms. The issues include improper text, missing background, blank slides, improper SmartArt, incorrect table and different charts elements rendering.

We have rectified issues that appeared when accessing, saving and rendering presentation to PDF, HTML or slide thumbnails, which resulted in different exceptions like NullReference, PptxReadException, ObjectReferenceException,and IllegalArgumentException in previous releases for MAC, Linux and Windows environments.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Refer to the article Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for Java 15.2.0 for further reference.
