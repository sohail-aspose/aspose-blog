Hello readers, in this blog I would like to introduce you with new features included in Aspose.Imaging 19.9. The best thing about Aspose team is that it releases both .NET and Java-based APIs simultaneously every month. This way both API user remain recurrent with changes being made in APIs every month.

In the following sections, I am going to give you a walk through of what new features have been included in API.

## Deskew a Scanned Image

Skew is an artifact that might appear during document scanning process and it consists of getting the documentâ€™s text/images be rotated at a slight angle. It can have various causes but the most common are paper getting misplaced during a scan. Therefore, **deskew** is the process of detecting and fixing this issue on scanned files (ie, bitmap) so deskewed images will have the text/images correctly and horizontally aligned.

The following examples demonstrate use of de-skewing an image using API.

The similar Java based implementation is like as under:

## Performance Improvements in API  

As against previous API versions, we have tend to improve the API performance in many areas when performing different operations including:

*   Raster Images filtering operations
*   Dithering operations in Raster Images
*   Image resize operations

Wait, there's many other features, enhancement, and bug fixes included in this release. [Here you can get the detail!][1]

When time allows you can check out API [examples at Github][2], talk about this release and other API related issues in our [forum][3].
