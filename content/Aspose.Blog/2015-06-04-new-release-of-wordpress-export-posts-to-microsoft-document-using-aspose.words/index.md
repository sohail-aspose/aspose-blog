Aspose DOC Exporter exports posts into a Word document file (DOC/DOCX). This plugin works as a bulk action of posts or pages or any custom post type. The Aspose Doc Exporter Plugin for WordPress allows administrators to export post contents and post comments to Microsoft Word (Doc/Docx/Rtf/Txt/Odt/Dot/Dotx) document. This module demonstrates the very powerful export feature provided by Aspose.Words. It adds a simple bulk action in the drop down "Aspose Export to File" and as soon as the bulk action is called, it exports all posts to a Microsoft Word (Doc/Docx/Rtf/Txt/Odt/Dot/Dotx) document.
