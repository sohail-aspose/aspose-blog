We are pleased to announce that our 3D API for Java named [Aspose.3D for Java][1] API is coming soon. We have received requests from clients to release the Java version of Aspose.3D API to work with Java application projects, since we are about to fulfill their requirement. With the addition of Aspose.3D for Java API, developers would be able to import and export 3D models into the supported formats, access 3D elements for editing purposes, and build a 3D model from scratch. They can also build GPU and CAD friendly geometries as well as skeletal animation and morphing.

## Java 3D API - Salient Features

[Aspose.3D for .NET][2] API has already been released around 2 or 3 years ago. Aspose.3D for Java API will be auto-ported from the equivalent version of Aspose.3D for .NET API, since developers will get the same features and supported file formats on both platforms.

## Independent of any External Software Package

Aspose.3D for Java API is easy to use compiled JAR to work with 3D file formats, it does not depend on any external API or software installation.

## Aspose.3D for .NET Resources
