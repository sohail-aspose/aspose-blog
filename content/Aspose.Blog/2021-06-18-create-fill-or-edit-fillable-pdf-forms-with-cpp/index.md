With the advent of computers and the internet, a lot of information is captured digitally. Different companies came up with solutions to make this process more efficient. One such solution is the fillable PDF forms. PDF forms are a popular choice that makes it easy to capture information digitally. PDF forms may be used for capturing survey data or as admission forms. In light of this, this article will teach you **how to create, fill and edit fillable PDF forms using C++**.

## C++ API for Creating, Filling, and Editing Fillable PDF Forms {#CPP-API-for-Creating-Filling-and-Editing-Fillable-PDF-Forms}

[Aspose.PDF for C++][6] is a C++ library that allows you to create, read and update PDF documents. Furthermore, the API supports creating, filling, and editing fillable PDF forms. You can either install the API through [NuGet][7] or download it directly from the [downloads][8] section.

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.PDF.Cpp
```

## Create Fillable PDF Forms using C++ {#Create-Fillable-PDF-Forms-using-CPP}

In this example, we will create a form from scratch with two text boxes and one radio button. However, one text box is multi-line, and the other is single line. The following are the steps to create a form in a PDF file.

*   Create an instance of the [Document][9] class.
*   Add a blank page to the document.
*   Create an instance of the [TextBoxField][10] class.
*   Set the properties of the [TextBoxField][11] like [FontSize][12], [Color][13], etc.
*   Create an instance of the second [TextBoxField][14] and set its properties.
*   Add both text boxes to the form using the [Document->get\_Form()->Add(System::SharedPtr<Field> field, int32\_t pageNumber)][15] method.
*   Create a table.
*   Create an instance of the [RadioButtonField][16] class.
*   Add the RadioButton to the form using the [Document->get\_Form()->Add(System::SharedPtr<Field> field, int32\_t pageNumber)][17] method.
*   Create two instances of the [RadioButtonOptionField][18] class to represent the options of the radio button.
*   Set the [OptionName][19], [Width][20], and [Height][21] and add the options to the radio button using the [RadioButtonField->Add(System::SharedPtr<RadioButtonOptionField> const & newItem)][22] method.
*   Add the options of the radio button to the cells of the table using the [Cell->get\_Paragraphs()->Add(System::SharedPtr<BaseParagraph> paragraph)][23] method.
*   Save the output file using the [Document->Save(System::String outputFileName)][24] method.

The following sample code shows how to create a form in a PDF file using C++.

## Fill an Existing Form in a PDF File using C++ {#Fill-an-Existing-Form-in-a-PDF-File-using-CPP}

In this example, we will use the file generated in the previous example. We will load the file using the [Document][25] class and fill its fields. The following are the steps to fill the fields of an existing PDF form.

*   Load the PDF file using the [Document][26] class.
*   Retrieve the TextBoxFields using the [Document->get\_Form()->idx\_get(System::String name)][27] method.
*   Set the values of both the TextBoxFields using the [TextBoxField->set\_Value(System::String value)][28] method.
*   Retrieve the [RadioButtonField][29] using the [Document->get\_Form()->idx\_get(System::String name)][30] method.
*   Set the value of the [RadioButtonField][31] using the [RadioButtonField->set\_Selected(int32\_t value)][32] method.
*   Save the output file using the [Document->Save(System::String outputFileName)][33] method.

The following sample code shows how to fill an existing form in a PDF file using C++.

{{< figure align=center src="images/FillFormFieldsPdfCpp-1024x661.png" alt="Image of the PDF file generated by the sample code" caption="Image of the PDF file generated by the sample code">}}


## Modify the Value of a Form Field in a PDF Form using C++ {#Modify-the-Value-of-a-Form-Field-in-a-PDF-Form-using-CPP}

With Aspose.PDF for C++, we can also modify the value of a previously filled field. In this example, we will use the file generated in the previous example and modify the value of the first [TextBoxField][34]. To achieve this, please follow the steps given below.

*   Load the PDF file using the [Document][35] class.
*   Retrieve the [TextBoxField][36] using the [Document->get\_Form()->idx\_get(System::String name)][37] method.
*   Update the value of the [TextBoxField][38] using the [TextBoxField->set\_Value(System::String value)][39] method.
*   Save the output file using the [Document->Save(System::String outputFileName)][40] method.

The following sample code shows how to modify the value of a field in a PDF form using C++.

## Delete a Form Field from an Existing PDF Form using C++ {#Delete-a-Form-Field-from-an-Existing-PDF-Form-using-CPP}

The API also allows you to delete form fields from existing PDF forms. The following are the steps to delete a form field from a PDF form.

*   Load the PDF file using the [Document][41] class.
*   Delete the field using the [Document->get\_Form()->Delete(System::String fieldName)][42] method.
*   Save the output file using the [Document->Save(System::String outputFileName)][43] method.

The following sample code shows how to delete a form field from an existing PDF form using C++.
