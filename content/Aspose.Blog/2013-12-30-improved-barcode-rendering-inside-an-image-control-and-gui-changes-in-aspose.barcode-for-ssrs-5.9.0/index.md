[](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/04/aspose.barcode-logo2.jpg)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.BarCode for SSRS 5.9.0.0. This new release improves barcode rendering inside an image control. It can also improve the overall performance of your reports. The Code128 CodeSet GUI option has now been removed. It was available in barcode properties GUI. It allowed you to encode with different codesets whereas you do not need to worry about it anymore as it is now controlled internally. This release also includes the most recent internal improvements.

To view a complete list of new features, fixes and enhancements [download the new release of Aspose.BarCode for SSRS][1].
