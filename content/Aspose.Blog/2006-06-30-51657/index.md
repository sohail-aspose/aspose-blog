Dear Customers,

We've released Aspose.Network 2.4.5.0 hotfix.

In this hotfix,

*   Fix a bug in BeginDownload function of the FtpClient class, which may lead to close the local stream before download completed
*   Add a new property namely RemoteTagetPath in TransferBroken EventArgs and TranferCompleted EventArgs. Therefore, we can use this property to determines which remote file is the uploading or downloading.

Thanks
