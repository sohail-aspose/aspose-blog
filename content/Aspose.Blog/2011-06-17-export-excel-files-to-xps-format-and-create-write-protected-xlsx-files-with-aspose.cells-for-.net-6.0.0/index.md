![Aspose.Cells icon][1]

We have just released the Aspose.Cells for .NET v6.0.0. In this version, we have added support for exporting Excel files to XPS documents; this is long-awaited feature for some clients. You can also create write-protected XLSX files. You may specify tables as source for the named ranges. You can expand/collapse buttons for a pivot table report.

The web control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET now supports Internet Explorer 9 and Google Chrome browsers. The desktop control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET allows you to set a picture as background image for the button control of a cell.

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
