[![Aspose.Diagram for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/06/aspose-Diagram-for-net_100.png)We're pleased to announce that the [new version 6.5.0 of Aspose.Diagram for .NET API][2] is now live. This new version is a maintenance release. It comes with the general improvements for stability along with the regular bug fixes. It gives robust updates in reading comments from VSD diagram, retrieves connection points of shape from VSS stencil and brings improvements in the rendering of text styled as subscript or superscript. We recommend our clients upgrade old version of Aspose.Diagram API to this latest one. For details on API fixes, please check Release Notes having complete list of bug fixes and enhancements.

## Read Comments from VSD File

Developers might save comments in the Visio diagram to describe the functional complexities of design. It helps the team members to share all the design information and to know progresses by sharing reviews on their part. Aspose.Diagram API allows developers to automate the task of retrieving comments from VSD diagram. We have enhanced this feature to get the expected results. We're also gradually enhancing Aspose.Diagram API to make it easier than ever before for the developers.

## Preserve Connection Points of Shape on Fetching from VSS Stencil

A connection point is a special point on a shape which can "glue" connectors and other shapes. When we glue a connector or shape to a connection point, they stay connected, even if one of the shapes is moved. Using Aspose.Diagram API, developers can retrieve the shapes from a visio stencil. This enhancement gives reliance over fetching all connection points of various shapes available in the VSS type stencils.

## Render Visio Text with Subscript and Superscript

A subscript or superscript is a number, figure, symbol, or indicator that is positioned slightly higher or slightly lower than the text on the normal line. For example, a footnote or endnote number reference is an example of superscript, and a scientific formula might use subscript text. This new version brings improvements in rendering of text styled as subscript or superscript.

This version also addresses the issues of missing text items, partial rendering of the dynamic connectors, missing background color of the checkboxes and radio boxes as well as the resolution change of the output graphics. These bug fixes also improve the performance of Aspose.Diagram API. Please check a list of the resolved defects:

*   Fixed: VSDX to PDF and HTML conversion - the arrows of dynamic connectors are not preserved.
    
*   Fixed: VSDX to PDF conversion - the incorrect sequence of line breaks in text items.
