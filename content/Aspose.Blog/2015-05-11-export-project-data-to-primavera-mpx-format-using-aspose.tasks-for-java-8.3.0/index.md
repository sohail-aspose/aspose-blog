We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Tasks for Java 8.3.0][2]. Ported from its equivalent .NET version, this month’s release introduces the same new features, enhancements and improvements. Complete details of the API changes can be found in our document article, Public API Changes in Aspose.Tasks for Java.

This blog provides details about the new features, enhancements and improvements incorporated in this month’s release.

# New Features and Enhancements

**Exporting Project Data to Primavera MPX format:** Application developers can now use Aspose.Tasks API for exporting Microsoft Project data to Primavera MPX format. Until now, the API only supported exporting project data to Primavera XML and XER formats. More Info

**Setting Start Date for Gantt Chart View:** This month’s release introduces the capability of setting the start date of Gantt chart view while saving the file. The _TimeScaleStart_ property exposed by _Prj_ class allows setting the start date of Gantt chart view. However, if the saved file is opened by MSP in maximized window mode, the timescale start date will not match.

**Support for Recurring Tasks:** This month’s release also provides support for reading/writing recurring task information. This enables to update recurring information of a task such as Occurrences count. The feature currently supports writing the information to output MPP file. At present, generation of recurring task’s children is not implemented yet and we plan to implement the feature in near future.

# Other Improvements

This month’s release also includes a number of bugs that were fixed in the equivalent .NET version of the API. This also includes performance related issue while adding resource assignments to the project.

In case you have got any query, please feel free to write to us over [Aspose.Tasks forum][3]. We’ll be glad to address your concerns and assist you further.
