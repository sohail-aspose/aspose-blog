![Aspose.Pdf icon][1]

We just have been able to release another version of Aspose.Pdf for .NET which gives us more confidence while converting HTML pages into PDF format. There has been a remarkable improvement while converting TIFF images into PDF file and also this release version has made our product more compatible with non-English characters especially Arabic characters. Some other issues related to Table rendering, image placement while using BindFO and minor issues related to Table Of Contents are also fixed in this release.

For more information regarding issues fixed in this release, please check out [Aspose.Pdf for .NET 5.3.0][2].
