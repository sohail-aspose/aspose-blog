Aspose.Report for .NET 2.4.0 has been released. This release includes the new event to get the name of the currently selected field. You can use this event to know the name of the field your clients are querying against.

This release also includes the features to set the space between LegendItems, space between the Axis line and the custom AxisLabels and the font size in a LegendBox. Previously, automatic adjustment of the LegendBox’s font size could not be disabled and users were unable to increase the font size after a specific size. Now users can specify any font size for the LegendBox.
