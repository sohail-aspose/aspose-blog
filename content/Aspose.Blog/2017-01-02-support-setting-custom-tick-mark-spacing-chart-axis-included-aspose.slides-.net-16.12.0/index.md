We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for .NET 16.12.0 that is the last product release of 2016. This is primarily a maintenance release whereby we have rectified many issues incurring in the product along with the inclusion of some new features.

## New Features

We have improved the MSO charts support in this release and now you can set the custom distance between tick mark positions of the horizontal axis. We have also enhanced the HTML export by providing options like imaging compression, picture cropped area, and external fonts handling in HTMLOptions and SVGOptions classes.

## Resolved Issues

We have resolved the issues related to presentation saving which earlier resulted in missing or wrong fonts, missing headers, improper text, missing hyperlinks and wrong line styles for shapes in saved presentations. We have also addressed the presentation access and saving issues have been rectified for many presentation decks that resulted in exceptions including KeyNotFoundException, ArgumentException, NotImplementedException and PptxReadException in previous releases. The presentation to SVG export has also been improved in this release and issues related to rendering as well as export exception issues have been rectified.

We have improved the presentation rendering support as well in this release and have rectified several rendering issues including improper charts rendering, missing slides, improper or missing text, wrong chart elements, wrong fonts, and low-quality images export SVG, PDF, thumbnails and HTML file formats. We have also addressed the presentation cloning issues which earlier resulted in incorrect text rendering in cloned slides.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for .NET 16.12.0 Release Notes][1] for further reference.
