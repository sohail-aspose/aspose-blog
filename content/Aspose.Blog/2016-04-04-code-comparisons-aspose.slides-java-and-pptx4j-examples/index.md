Project [Aspose.Slides Java for Pptx4j][1] shows how different tasks can be performed using Aspose.Slides for Java APIs in comparison with Pptx4j. Aspose.Slides Java for Pptx4j also covers the features that are only available in Aspose.Slides for Java API but not in Pptx4j.

## Aspose.Slides for Java

[Aspose.Slides for Java][2] is a unique PowerPoint management component that enables Java based applications to read, write and manipulate PowerPoint documents without using Microsoft PowerPoint.

One can generate, modify, copy, convert, render and print presentations without installing Microsoft PowerPoint.
