[![Aspose.Imaging for .NET][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/03/aspose.imaging-logo2.jpg)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Imaging for .NET 1.5.0. This month’s release provides extensive support for the TIFF image format. You can now load TIFF images and export any image to TIFF format. This release also provides the means to concatenate several images to one multi-page TIFF as well as save each frame/page of a multi-page TIFF to a separate image of any supported format.

We have also provided the support for some of the widely used compression algorithms. At the moment, the supported compression types for TIFF image format are:

*   CCITT Fax Group 3
*   CCITT Fax Group 4
*   RLE
