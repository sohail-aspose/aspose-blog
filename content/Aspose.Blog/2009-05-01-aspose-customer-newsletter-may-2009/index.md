#### Aspose.Words supports Glossary Documents in OOXML

[](https://docs.aspose.com/display/wordsjava/Home)[][19]The latest version 6.3.0.0 of [Aspose.Words][20] for .NET has been released. Earlier versions of Aspose.Words ignored Glossary Documents and therefore after an open/save cycle using Aspose.Words your Glossary Document was always missing in the output file. Aspose.Words now preserves Glossary Documents during open/save cycles (in OOXML files only at the moment). Glossary Documents can occur in OOXML and in DOC files. Support for glossary in DOC will be available later. Also included with this release are numerous other improvements and bug fixes.

#### Aspose.Words for JasperReports released

[](http://www.aspose.com/categories/jasperreports-exporters/aspose.words-for-jasperreports/default.aspx)The Aspose.Words family is growing again. We are happy to announce our brand new product, [Aspose.Words for JasperReports][26]. Aspose.Words for JasperReports is the only known solution on the market that makes possible exporting reports from JasperReports and JasperServer to editable Microsoft Word documents with the highest degree of precision. JasperReports and JasperServer do not have built-in abilities to export reports as Microsoft Word documents; the only exception is the RTF format that uses positioned items such as textboxes, which makes the generated documents very hard to edit. Using Aspose.Words for JasperReports, you will get access to such formats as DOC, DOCX, HTML, and TXT. The documents produced by Aspose.Words for JasperReports are easy to edit in Microsoft Word. For more details, please consult the official [release page][27] and the relevant blog post. The latest version of Aspose.Words for JasperReports can be downloaded from [here][28].
