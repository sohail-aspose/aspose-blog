We have published the new version of [Aspose.PDF for Java][1]. In Aspose.PDF for Java 3.1.0, the text extraction mechanism has been improved not only for total text extraction but also the text extraction by rectangle using extractTextInRectangle method. We have also enhanced the replace text mechanism. You can now wordwrap the replaced text as well, if the new text is longer than the page width. Please see the details and an example in the following topic: Setting Wordwrap while replacing text and using  
ReplaceTextStrategy class

You can see the complete list of changes and download the latest version from the [Aspose.PDF for Java download section][2].
