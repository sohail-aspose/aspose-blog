We are increasing the price of some of our products from the _1st_ _July 2011_, there has never been a better time to invest in Aspose or renew your current subscription!

Aspose are committed to providing industry leading software components with the most competitive licensing and support pricing.

We have dedicated thousands of man-hours to developing features and enhancing our existing product range, while also expanding our product and support offerings.  For example, in the last year alone we have introduced Aspose.Words V10,  Aspose.Network for Java / Sharepoint and Aspose.Diagram.

In spite of this, we have made very little change to our pricing in over 5 years.  On the 1st July we are raising the price of some of our products and product suites. This allows us to continue growing our research and development activities to ensure we remain at the forefront of file format technology. We are passionate about ensuring our customers are using the best possible solutions.

Recent developments include:-

*   Major new release of Aspose.Words (version 10) with hundreds of new features and bugs fixes. We have also synchronized the development of .NET and Java versions of this product
*   New products added to our range in last year include Aspose.Network for Java / SharePoint, Aspose.Diagram and Aspose.Pdf for JasperReports
*   Continual improvements to the Aspose.Cells product including addition of support for Excel 2010 encryption, reading pivot tables and other performance enhancements and fixes.
*   Release of Aspose.Total for Sharepoint product suite.
*   Continuous roll out of support for Sharepoint 2010, including a release of Aspose.Slides for SharePoint 1.10
*   Extensive redevelopment of PDF and PDF.Kit with a merged product to be released during July 2011
