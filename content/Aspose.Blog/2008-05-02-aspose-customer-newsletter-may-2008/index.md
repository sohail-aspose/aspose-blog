**Technical Tip** – How to efficiently use Aspose.Slides in your applications

**Speed optimizations**  
  
[Aspose.Slides][30] has many features for managing presentations. Some of these features are quite efficient in terms of execution speed while others are a bit time consuming. The main idea of speed optimization is replace slow operations with their more efficient alternatives where possible. Following are some useful operation replacements:

1.  When creating presentations from templates try to avoid cloning slides from one presentation to another. Sometimes it’s better to open template and delete unnecessary slides instead of cloning each slide from the template to an empty presentation.  
    
2.  If you are creating a presentation with several similar slides then avoid cloning each slide from template. You should do it only once and after that clone this created slide inside your target presentation. Cloning local slides is more efficient than cloning between presentations.
3.  Create whole table at once if possible instead of adding new columns and rows later. This can also reduce memory usage.
4.  Fill table cells row by row from left to right and from top to bottom. Another order can slow down the process dramatically.

**Size optimization**  
  
Most of the optimization tasks related to size of the presentation are executed automatically by Aspose.Slides when you save the presentation to a file or stream. However there are several additional ways to further reduce the size of the presentation:  
  

1.  Don’t forget to delete unused master slides and handout.
2.  Reuse fonts and images in a presentation.
3.  Delete alternative text from shapes if you are not going to use it later.
4.  Insert common shapes and images to master slide.
5.  Minimize the number of text portions if possible.
