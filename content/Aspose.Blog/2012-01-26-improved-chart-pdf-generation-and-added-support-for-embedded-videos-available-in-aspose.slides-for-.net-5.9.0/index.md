We have released Aspose.Slides for .NET 5.9.0. This is a maintenance release and is much stable version as compared to its predecessor. In this new release, improved support for accessing presentations causing issues  in earlier versions have been resolved. Since, PowerPoint 2010 supports embedded videos inside presentation and Aspose.Slides for .NET lacked the capability to preserve embedded videos inside saved presentations. But, support for embedded videos has been provided in this new release. The support for enhanced PDF generation by reducing the PDF size and still maintaining its quality has also been added.

In order to view a complete list of fixes and to download Aspose.Slides for .NET 5.9.0, please [go to the download page][2].
