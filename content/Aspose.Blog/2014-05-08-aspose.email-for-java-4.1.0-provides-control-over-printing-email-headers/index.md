![](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/05/aspose-Email-for-Java_100.png "aspose-Email-for-Java_100")We are pleased to share that Aspose.Email for Java 4.1.0 has been released. Ported from its equivalent .NET version, this month’s release fixes all bugs reported for last month’s version. It not only contains bug fixes, but also introduces enhancements to existing features of the API.

## Display/Hide Extra Print Headers

The Aspose.Email API provides the capability to convert email messages to MHTML for a while. In some messages, however, an extra “From” field is displayed in the converted MHTML file due to the internal message specifications . Though this has been part of the conversion since the very beginning, users may not require it and want to avoid it. This month’s release provides the option to avoid printing the extra print header with the help of MhtFormatOptions and MailMessageSaveOptions enumerator.

## Bug Fixes and API Improvements

This month’s release also fixes a number of bugs as reported by our customers for the last version of Aspose.Email for Java. Fixing of these issues brings further improvements to the following areas of the API:

*   Message conversion between various formats such as EML to MSG and MHTML.
*   Encoding issues during conversion of messages.
*   Messages addition to Personal Storage (PST) files.
*   Message attachments.
*   Rich Text Format (RTF) compression algorithm.

In additional to these bug fixes, this month’s release also resolves a number of reported exceptions, for example, during email reading, VCard loading and OST to PST conversion.
