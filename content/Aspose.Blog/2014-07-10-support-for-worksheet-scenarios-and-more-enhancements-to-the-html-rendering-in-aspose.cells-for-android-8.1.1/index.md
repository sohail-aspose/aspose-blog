[![Aspose.Cells for Android logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/06/aspose-Cells-for-Android_100.png)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Cells for Android 8.1.1. The new version contains many useful enhancements.  It also includes several fixes and other improvements. Below, we list the major features and enhancements in this month’s release.

## Support for Scenarios

Scenarios are part of a suite of commands called what-if analysis tools provided by Microsoft Excel. What-if analysis is the process of changing the values in cells to see how those changes affect the outcome of formulas on the worksheet. They are useful for forecasting and financial models. Microsoft Excel saves a set of values in a scenario, and can automatically substitute these values in the worksheet.

Aspose.Cells for Android has provided support for scenarios to allow you to create, manipulate and remove scenarios without the need of Microsoft Excel. Aspose.Cells for Android has exposed many useful classes, a few of the most important classes are listed below. A detailed article is available at working with scenarios.

*   Scenario: Represents an individual scenario.
*   ScenarioCollection: Represents a collection of scenarios.
*   ScenarioInputCellCollection: Represents a list of input cells for a particular scenario.
*   ScenarioInputCell: Represents an input cell from the collection of input cells for a particular scenario.

## Enhancements to HtmlSaveOptions

The class HtmlSaveOptions has been enhanced further to render HTML results with better layout and presentation. The feature is now available through the Boolean PresentationPreference property which can be set to true when exporting spreadsheets to HTML format to get a better presentation layout. For further elaboration on this topic, please check the detailed article on using the PresentationPreference option.

## Bug Fixes

Aspose.Cells for Android 8.1.1 has provided fixes and other enhancements for several important issues, such as, reading Microsoft Excel files, manipulating styles and calculating formulas, manipulating charts and shapes, rendering & manipulating conditional formatting, fonts related issues while rendering to PDF files, Sheet to image bugs and localized formulas formats etc.
