We are pleased to announce the new release of [Aspose.Words for JasperReports][1]. We have upgraded this release to the latest version of Aspose.Words for Java 18.2 and added support to embed fonts in output DOC, DOCX and RTF file formats. 

We have added new configuration option EMBED\_FONTS in Aspose.Words for JasperReports 18.2. By default, value of EMBED\_FONTS parameter is **false**. This means that Aspose Words for JasperReports will not embed fonts into the resulting document. However, you can enable this option by setting it to true if you need to force embedding fonts into the resulting document. Please see the [release notes][2] for more detail. You can download the latest release of Aspose.Words for JasperReports 18.2 from the following link:

*   6.4.2 and higher (**aspose.words.jasperreports-6.4.2.jar)**
