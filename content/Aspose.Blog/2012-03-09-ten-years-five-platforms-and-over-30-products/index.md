[![Celebrating 10 years of business][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/03/blog-entry-square.jpg)In the ten years since Aspose started trading, we have developed a number of different products. We currently support over 30 products over the five platforms that we support (.NET, Java, SharePoint, SSRS and JasperReports). Many of our products exist, with the same or slightly different features, on all five platforms. .NET is usually the first platform that a product is introduced on. If it is successful, of if there's particular demand, we'll port it to another platform.

Our first products were all for .NET. We introduced our first Java products in 2005 and added Reporting Services in 2007. This was followed by JasperReports Â in 2008 and our most recent platform addition, SharePoint, later the same year.

# Aspose.Cells

Aspose.Cells for .NET came on the market in January 2003. It was our first official product although Aspose had already delivered smaller controls and APIs to customers. In the years since the first version of Aspose.Cells, the product has developed and has a lot more features than that first version did. You now also get it on five platforms.

# Aspose.Pdf

"_A class library for working with PDF files from within .NET applications_" is how we described Aspose.Pdf for .NET, our first Aspose.Pdf component, when we announced it in March, 2003. It is that and so much more. Since it was first announced, Aspose.Pdf has gone through several changes. 2011 was a special year for Aspose.Pdf. First, Aspose.Pdf for .NET incorporated the features of Aspose.Pdf.Kit so that .NET developers can create and work with PDF documents easily. Then Aspose.Pdf was released for the last of the platforms we support: SharePoint.

# Aspose.Words

First released in 2003, only months after Aspose.Cells, Aspose.Words allows developers on all our supported platforms to work with Microsoft Word and other word processing file formats. Aspose.Words has also been developed for all five platforms.

Aspose.Words has marked many Aspose firsts. It was the first Aspose product to be autoported so that the .NET and Java versions are derived from the same code and have the same features. It was the first Aspose product to reach version 10. It has also been the first product on a new platform more than once.

# Aspose.BarCode

![Aspose.BarCode logo][8]

Barcodes are everywhere. The latest addition to the wide range of barcodes that consumers are aware of, the QR code, is supported by Aspose.BarCode. When Aspose.BarCode was first released in 2005, the QR code was not as well known to consumers but was used by industry. Barcodes are great for tracking documents, consignments, products - anything that needs tracking. With Aspose.BarCode, developers have can read or create barcodes easily on .NET, Java, Reporting Services or JasperReports. We support a great range of barcodes and keep adding new ones.
