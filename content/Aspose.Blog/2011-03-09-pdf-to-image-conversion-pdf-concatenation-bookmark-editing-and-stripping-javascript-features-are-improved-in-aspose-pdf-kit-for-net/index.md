Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET 5.4.0 is now available for download. In this latest version, we have improved PDF to image conversion, PDF file concatenation, bookmark editing, and JavaScript stripping features. Previously, we introduced Strip method to remove JavaScript from the PDF file. This method enabled you to provide input and output PDF files as string parameters -- file paths. We had discussed this earlier in this post. However, with this latest release, we have added an overloaded Strip method to support streams as well -- FileStream or MemoryStream etc. This new overloaded method will help you process the PDF file in memory, without saving it to the disk. And this will definitely increase the performance of your application. In addition to that, we have enhanced PDF to image conversion to produce better quality output images from the PDF files. Bookmark editing has also been enhanced to support bigger files, while improving performance. You can see the complete list of changes and download the latest version from the [Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET download section][1].
