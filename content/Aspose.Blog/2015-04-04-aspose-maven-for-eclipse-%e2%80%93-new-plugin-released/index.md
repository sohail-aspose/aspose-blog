{{< figure align=center src="images/S9hjotX.jpg" alt="">}}


Aspose releases new Eclipse IDE plugin to further facilitates [Aspose.Total for Java APIs][1] in easy to use in Maven-based projects.

New plugin **Aspose Maven for Eclipse** \- v1.0.0 comes with **Aspose Maven Project Wizard** which creates maven project by selecting Aspose Java APIs (like Aspose.Words, Aspose.Pdf or Aspose.Cells) on the wizard steps and the selected Aspose API's maven dependencies will appear in newly created maven project's pom.xml.

Previously, Aspose also released Aspose Maven Project Archetype 1.0 for the creation of Aspose Maven-based projects in Major IDEs including Eclipse or through the Maven command line.

But this **Aspose Maven for Eclipse** plugin provides a more sophisticated solution through fine-grained and guiding UI for selecting Aspose for Java APIs and Maven project artifact inputs.

Once you installed plugin (See downloading and installation wiki of the plugin). Plugin introduces new Project Wizard option with the name of  "**Aspose Maven Project"** within **Aspose Maven** category as shown below:
