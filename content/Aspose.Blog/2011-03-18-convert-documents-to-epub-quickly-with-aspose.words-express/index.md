**New Zealand, Auckland – March 18, 2011 –** Since it became the official standard of the International Digital Publishing Forum in 2007, the EPUB format has become increasingly popular. A growing number of devices and readers can parse the format and the importance of digital publishing is growing. EPUB can be read by Android and iOS apps, by Sony Readers and a number of other devices and is a good format, along with PDF, for getting documents prepared for digital publishing.

Aspose has long experience of file conversion and creating [Word processing components for working with many formats, including DOC and EPUB][1]. Converting documents from one format to another can be frustrating and not all word processing applications support the EPUB format. Aspose has created a utility to handle this conversion.

# Aspose.Words Express

Aspose.Words Express takes several different formats (DOC, DOCX, RTF, HTML and ODT) and converts them to EPUB. It does this quickly and accurately. [Aspose.Words Express][2] is open to anyone to use to convert documents to EPUB files. It makes publishing documents in EPUB available to everyone.

# Features

Like any good conversion utility, Aspose.Words Express can control several aspects of the output document, from the image down-sampling to the number of levels in the navigation map. It makes it easy to control fonts, whether to export headers and footers and whether to split a document into several EPUB files.

Aspose’s tools are designed to be helpful and intuitive and Aspose.Words Express is too. It is easy to download and is run directly from an executable. The conversion process is very simple:

1.  Select settings.
2.  Select an input document.
3.  Set the output path.
4.  Convert.

That is all there is to it. [Download Aspose.Words Express][3] from the download section of Aspose's website and try it.

Aspose.Words Express replaces Aspose.Words for Microsoft Word. The new utility is stand-alone which makes it more useful than a Microsoft Word plug-in.
