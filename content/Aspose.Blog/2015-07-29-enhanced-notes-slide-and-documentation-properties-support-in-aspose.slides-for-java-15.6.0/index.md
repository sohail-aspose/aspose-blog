We like to share the release announcement of Aspose.Slides for Java 15.6.0. This is one of maintenance release in which we have resolved certain issues incurring in the product along with support for some new features.

## New Features

We have incorporated the support for better management of notes slides by introducing NotesSlideManger class under ISlide interface. Now you can add or remove the notes slides for any given slide by using properties available in NotesSlideManager class. We have also introduced the support for exception messages when loading the files other than support MS PowerPoint formats. We have improved the support for working with document properties by introducing the support for cleaning added document properties. Please visit the documentation article [Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for Java 15.6.0][1] for further reference.

## Resolved Issues

The issues related to generation of corrupted presentations and raising presentation repair message have also been addressed in this release. The presentation access and saving issues have been rectified for many presentation decks that earlier resulted in exceptions including NullPointer, ArgumentException , NegativeSeekOffset , PptException, Unsupported File Format and HeadlessException in previous releases.

We have enhanced the presentation rendering to HTML, PDF and images in this release for charts, text and SmartArt shapes. Many chart rendering issues including missing or improper chart axis, plot area and legends have been rectified. We have also addressed the rendering issues related to AutoShapes and Smart as well in this release. The issues related to text rendering in the form of improper text rendering and missing hyperlinks have also been addressed.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Refer to the article [Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for Java 15.6.0][2] for further reference.
