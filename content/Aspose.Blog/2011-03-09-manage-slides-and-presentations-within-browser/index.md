## About Tools4Office



{{< figure align=center src="images/Screenshot-2020-05-05-at-1.25.02-AM.png" alt="Tools4Office company logo">}}


We provide tools for MS Office products. Our main focus is on PowerPoint Add-ons.

Tjool is our software tool for presentation and Slide management for MS PowerPoint format and is available in 3 editions: Single User installation, Network-User license, and a web-based ASP system. The web-based Tjool edition is a presentation manager that requires no software to install or maintain and is used through a standard Internet Browser. Our customers, and especially enterprise customers, have a lot of presentations and they need to provide their employees and external partners with a way to access these presentations and slides and download them from anywhere. These files need to be updated and then uploaded into the ASP system.

## Requirement

Accessing presentations and slides in an effective way by viewing the single slides with zoom function and the ability to download them in the desired format i.e. PPT or PPTX.

The system specification from our customer was to organize a huge amount of PowerPoint-presentations on a web-based application. Several of the PowerPoint presentations have to be uploaded into the system and screenshots out of each slide shall be generated as JPEG/PNG and finally an ability to download in PPT/PPTX format. Indexing each slide with keywords for the further search was also a must.

## Solution

After evaluating various options, Tools4Office decided to use the [Aspose.Slides for .NET][1] for its application. We used [Aspose.Slides for .NET][2] in the uploading process in the system to generate screenshots. We found that it is exactly what we needed and that it fits our requirement of allowing the users to download the uploaded PowerPoint in PPTX or PPT format.

Specified below is a preview of an effective way to administer and organize slides and presentations using a standard Internet Browser.

## Benefits

[Aspose.Slides for .NET][3] helped Tools4Office to utilize better and easier ways to administer PowerPoint slides and presentations on the web.

Other benefits of [Aspose.Slides for .NET][4] are:

*   Easy embedding.
*   Updates, [Technical Support][5], and especially Hot Fixes are included in the first year.

## Next Steps

We implemented [Aspose.Slides for .NET][6] in Tjool - the presentations and slides manager. After listening to our clientâ€™s feedback, we may extend the use of [Aspose][7] for [generating PDF files][8].
