Aspose DOC Importer plugin for WordPress allows developers to get the contents of Microsoft Word (DOC/DOCX) documents without requiring Microsoft Office. This module demonstrates the powerful import feature provided by Aspose.Words . It adds a simple [**Aspose Doc Importer**][2] button on posts and pages. When users click the button, they get two options: importing from a local DOC file or from  Aspose Cloud Storage.  The user selects a file, clicks **Insert Doc to Editor** and the text is inserted into the editor from the selected file. This plugin uses the WordPress Media Up-loader for uploading local files. You can also select files from WordPress Media Gallery.
