[![Aspose.Cells for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Cells-for-net_100.png)Aspose.Cells for .NET 7.5.2 has been released. The new release supports adding custom data sorting. We have added some significant enhancements for copying ranges with conditional formatting and clearing the Textbox collection. We have fixed a few exceptions when reading and writing Excel files, and writing legend entries in charts.

In this release, several important issues have been addressed. For example, issues around rendering Microsoft Excel file formats, rendering and manipulating PivotTables, converting Excel files to HTML format, adding background watermarks in worksheets, rendering charts, rendering image files and exporting to PDF have been resolved. An improvement is also made pertaining to Aspose.Cells for .NET's formula calculation engine.

We have made a few enhancements and fixed some bugs regarding copying and pasting cells data and values, and response time when using Internet Explorer 10 in the web based Grid control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET. Â We also included a few enhancements regarding formula calculations and auto-filters in the desktop Grid control.
