We like to share the announcement of new release of Aspose.Slides for .NET 6.5.0. This is primarily a maintenance release but also includes some new features. A method that supports clearing the chart data sheet has been added, as has support for setting gap width and depth for 3D column charts. The long awaited support for adding slides in PPTX with different slides layouts has been introduced in this release. Some presentation access issues have been addressed and issues with presentation rendering bullets, charts and other shapes in exported PDF and thumbnails have been improved.  We have also enhanced the PDF export support by resolving an issue where text was scaled wrong.
