We are pleased to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for JasperReports 18.1.

This release has been built on the basis of latest Aspose.Slides for Java 18.1 API, which is enriched with improved text, chart and tables rendering support while exporting to PDF and XPS or TIFF images. The improved rendering will thus be helpful in generating presentation files from JasperReports.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for JasperReports 18.1 Release Notes][2] for further reference.
