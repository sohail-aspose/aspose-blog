We are pleased to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 18.6

This release has been developed based on Aspose.Slides for .NET 18.6, whereby we have provided improved MSO charts management support. We have also improved API rendering performance for exported PDF and slide thumbnails as well. This improved support in Aspose.Slides for .NET will achieve better rendering of SQL Server reports when exporting to PowerPoint or other formats using Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 18.6 Release Notes][1] for further reference.
