[](http://www.dddnorth.co.uk/)In June we sponsored DDD East Anglia. It was a very well-received event and we're pleased to have the opportunity to support [DDD North][1] this month.

## What is it?

DDD - Developer! Developer! Developer! - is a series of free technical community events for developers in the UK. It's a community event in the true sense of the word: the community suggests topics for discussions and votes on which topics are presented on the day. It lets developers share experiences and knowledge with their peers. This year, DDD North returns to the University of Sunderland.

We're delighted to sponsor an event that helps developers learn, share and stay interested in the their work. Software's not a job where you can stop learning if you want an interesting career, so user groups, conferences and community events like DDD are very important.
