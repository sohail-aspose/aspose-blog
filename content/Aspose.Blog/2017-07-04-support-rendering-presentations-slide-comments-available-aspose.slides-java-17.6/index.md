We are pleased to share the release announcement for [Aspose.Slides for Java][1] 17.6. This is primarily a maintenance release whereby we have added some new features in API as well.

## New Features

We have improved the presentation rendering by adding option to include slide comments inside exported HTML, PDF, SWF, TIFF and XPS. Please visit documentation articles, [Converting Presentation to HTML][2] and [Converting Presentation to SWF][3] for example codes. We have included the support for managing sections inside the presentation to hold group of slides for providing better organization of slides. Please visit documentation article, [Adding or Removing Sections][4] for further details.
