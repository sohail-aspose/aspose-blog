In case you forgot, some of Aspose employees are living upside down, having summer in December, and overall, doing lots of things differently.

Just to tease you all, summer is very nice in New Zealand, I love it, and it is here, almost.

Although I plan to work a lot as usual, it is a very relaxing feeling anyway. We are going to catch a lot of time at the beach and in the water since it is all so close. Kitesurfing and a bit of bodyboarding is in order. No need to take a vacation when work is a permanent holiday.

December is a time when [Pohutakawa][1] is flowering. Search [Google Images for "pohutakawa"][2] to get a better idea.

Here is one linked:

And another one from a friend of mine [http://nz.net.ru/daily/251/][3]

Have a nice Winter!
