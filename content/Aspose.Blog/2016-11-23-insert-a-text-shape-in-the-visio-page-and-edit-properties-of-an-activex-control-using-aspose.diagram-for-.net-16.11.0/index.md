[![Aspose.Diagram for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/06/aspose-Diagram-for-net_100.png)We're pleased to announce that the [new version 16.11.0 of Aspose.Diagram for .NET API][2] is now live. The new version of the API allows developers to insert a text shape in the Visio diagram. Developers can also now retrieve an ActiveX control to edit all its available properties. This month’s release also improves performance in converting VSD diagrams to PDF format and covers a number of regular bug fixes and enhancements. Developers can install an Aspose.Diagram Nuget package in their .NET applications because we publish each version as [a NuGet package on the NuGet gallery][3]. We recommend our clients upgrade old version of Aspose.Diagram API to this latest one. For details on API fixes, please check Release Notes having a complete list of the features, enhancements and bug fixes.

## Insert a Text Shape in the Visio Page

The Microsoft Office Visio application allows users to insert a text shape by clicking "A Text" button available in the **Home** tab under the **Tools** section. Using Aspose.Diagram API, developers can now achieve this feature in their project applications. From now onward, they may not add any alternative shapes from the stencil files. This help topic shows how to insert a text shape in the Visio page: Insert a Text Shape in the Visio Page

## Retrieve an ActiveX Control from a Shape Object to Modify Properties

The last couple of Aspose.Diagram API releases has the support of inserting an ActiveX control in the Visio page. Developers were not able to retrieve and edit an ActiveX control. Using this new version, developers can retrieve an ActiveX control from a shape object, and then edit its properties. This help topic shows a code example to achieve this: Retrieve an ActiveX Control from a Shape Object to Modify Properties

This version also addresses the issues of general formatting problems, the invisibility of the group shapes, rendering cross signs in place of the various shapes and other minor layout problems of the drawings. These enhancements and bug fixes improve performance and accuracy of Aspose.Diagram API. Please check a list of the resolved defects:
