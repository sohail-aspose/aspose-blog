![Aspose.BarCode logo][1]

We are happy to announce the release of a new version of Aspose.BarCode for .NET. In this major release, we added support for generating barcodes on Windows Phone 7. It currently supports most of 1D and postal barcode symbologies. 2D barcode generation will be added in future. Grab yourself a copy of [Windows Phone Developer tools][2] and start evaluating the barcode generation on Windows Phone 7.

Below is a screenshot of the Windows Phone 7 demo application included with Aspose.BarCode for .NET.
