[![Aspose.Email for .NET][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/07/aspose-Email-for-net_100.png)Aspose .NET Gmail Sync for Umbraco is an open source module from [Aspose][2] that links your Umbraco users/members to Google or Gmail contacts without requiring any other software. It uses the powerful features of [Aspose.Email for .NET][3] to allow you to easily sync your Gmail contacts and Umbraco users/members.

This initial version of the module is enriched with the following features to make the sync process effective, simple and easy to use.

*   Google/Gmail server credentials are encrypted and saved in the database so that you don’t have to enter them every time you use the module.
*   Sync all or selected Gmail contacts to Umbraco and vice versa.
*   Option to select one or more Umbraco user/member type when performing Gmail to Umbraco sync.
*   Existence of every contact/user in the destination system is checked before migration to make sure that the sync does not create duplicate records.
*   The contacts migrated to Gmail are put in Other Contacts group so that you can verify and move only required ones to My Contacts.
*   A brief summary of the sync process is shown upon completion.
