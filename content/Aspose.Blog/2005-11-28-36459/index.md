Please welcome our new team member Vladimir Averkin who is a dedicated Aspose.Word Technical Support person. He will be replying to your questions in the forums, creating more code examples and improving product documentation.

It is great to see our team growing as a result of the number of Aspose.Word customers growing. We hope to be able to provide even better support and deliver more new features faster.
