Aspose.PDF for Java 4.0.0 has been published. In this latest version, we have added two new features related to text extraction: extracting text to HTML and getting text formatting information along with extracted text. You can find the details and code samples in the following knowledgebase topics:

*   Extract text to HTML file
*   Extract text formatting information

In addition to that, we have fixed issues related to PDF flattening, annotation rendering, text replacement, form filling and flattening, PDF to image conversion, and image extraction.

You can find a list of all the fixed issues and download the latest version from [Aspose.PDF for Java download section][1].
