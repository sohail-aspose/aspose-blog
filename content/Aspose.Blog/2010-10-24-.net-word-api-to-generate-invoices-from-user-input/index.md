## About Gekom



{{< figure align=center src="images/Gekom.jpg" alt="Gekom company logo">}}


[Gekom][1] is an online web application that offers small companies and freelancers a secure, reliable, and easy way to manage their customersâ€™ quotes and invoices wherever they are. Gekom customers can quickly create and download an invoice in order to send it by e-mail or print it out.

## Requirements

During the development of Gekom, one of the major difficulties was to find the right way to handle document generation. While using a database engine to store user input is a very common issue that is not difficult for a developer to solve but document generation is not a straightforward task. The main requirements while building Gekom were:

*   To generate invoices from both user input and database records
*   To [include images such as company logos][2] on invoices
*   To be able to manage invoice templates easily

The third requirement was probably the most interesting to solve: the question was how to use Microsoft Word for authoring templates without using Microsoft Word for generating invoices?

## Actors

The above-specified scenario was supposed to be performed daily by all users of the application.

## Solution

After several tries and non-convincing results, the answer was found: [Aspose.Words for .NET][3].

## Products Used

[Aspose.Words for .NET][4] has been used to build this use case into an ASP.NET web application written in C#. The following functionalities of [Aspose.Words for .NET][5] were used:

*   Simple [mail merge using Microsoft Word][6] template
*   [Mail merge with regions][7]
*   [Image merge fields][8]
*   [Save Word document as PDF][9]

## Why Aspose?

As a software developer, we have been facing the document generation challenges several times, in several contexts. We already have been using:

*   Word/SpreadsheetML in conjunction with XML data and XSLT transforms
*   Office automation
*   XSL-FO language and processors  
    

But we were never convinced by any of these solutions: performance, easy templates management, and data integration requirements were never met all together.

Once we implemented real-world scenarios using [Aspose.Words for .NET][10], we got to know for the first time, which components we will continue using.

## Future Implementations

[Aspose.Words for .NET][11] provided a so simple solution to our main requirement (_that was to be able to [manage templates using Microsoft Word][12]_), that we seriously consider extending the use of other components. We consider providing the end-users with a way to generate monthly Excel extracts using [Aspose.Cells for .Net][13].

## Conclusion

We are really convinced about the quality and the robustness of [Aspose components][14] and would recommend every software developer to have a look at it.
