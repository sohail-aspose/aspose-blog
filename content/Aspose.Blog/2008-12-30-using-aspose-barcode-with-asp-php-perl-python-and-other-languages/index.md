Aspose.BarCode component is designed to work with .NET  and Java applications, but its possible to use it in other languages like ASP using VBScript, Perl, PHP, Python, PowerBuilder etc. We have added some new pages in our product documentation on how to use Aspose.BarCode with these languages. Check out http://www.aspose.com/documentation/visual-components/aspose.barcode-for-.net-and-java/Utilize-Aspose-BarCode-in-Other-Programming-Languages.html for details. If you need support for using Aspose.BarCode in any of the listed languages or any other language of your choice, please feel free to post on our forum at [http://www.aspose.com/community/forums/aspose.barcode-for-.net-java-and-reporting-services/193/showforum.aspx][1].
