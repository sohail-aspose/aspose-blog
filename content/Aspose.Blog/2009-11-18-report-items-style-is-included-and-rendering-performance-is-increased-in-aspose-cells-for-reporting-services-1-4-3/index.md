We have just released Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services v1.4.3 for the users.

In this version, the Rendering Performance is increased. The Aspose.Cells.ReportingServices Client tool, now, supports Reporting Services 2008 report format. The component includes report items style in the report that is created by the report designer. Moreover, the Aspose.Cells.ReportingServices Client is enhanced regarding the Reporting Serverâ€™s connectivity. There are some other fixes and enhancements too.
