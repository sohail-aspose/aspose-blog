I am happy to announce that Aspose.Words Documentation was updated. It now includes all code examples in three languages: C#, VB.NET and Java!

The Getting Started and Programmer's Guide sections were updated. They contain over 100 code examples. See http://www.aspose.com/documentation/file-format-components/aspose.words-for-.net-and-java/the-mergeimagefield-event.html for an example.

The Aspose.Words API Reference had all examples in C#, VB.NET and Java already.
