Aspose.Diagram, Aspose.Words Express and Awesome Customer Service

Happy Spring! Thank you for taking the time to read this newsletter. This month we've got some really great product news.  
We've just released the highly anticipated Aspose.Diagram for .NET. Aspose.Diagram for .NET allows you to process and manipulate Microsoft Visio files from within your applications. As ever, Aspose.Total customers can download and use the new product instantly. Find out more.  
We've also just released Aspose.Words Express, a freeware tool that allows you to convert DOC, DOCX, RTF, HTML and ODT documents to EPUB. All you need to do is select a source file, a destination and click the Convert button. Do you have any awkward file formats you'd love to get onto your e-reader? Aspose.Express makes it easy.  
Aspose.Words for .NET is now fully autoported to Java and has passed the 9700+ unit tests that we run against each build to ensure everything works. We've still got some work to do, but you'll be seeing a lot more about this release in the very near future.  
Amazing customer service  
Only a few times in my life have I really experienced awesome customer service. When you are on the receiving end of excellent customer service you always remember it. I recently took my wife's broken Macbook Pro to an Apple Genius Bar. The Apple representative diagnosed the issue as a known fault and promptly booked the laptop in for a full complementary motherboard replacement even though the computer was 3 years out of warranty. Two days later the laptop was back in our hands in perfect working condition. I couldn't have asked for more: I am one happy customer.  
I've been reading _Delivering Happiness_ by Tony Hsieh the CEO of Zappos. He built his company around an ethos of incredible customer service. I've heard about when a Zappos employee booked aeroplane tickets and hand delivered a pair of shoes to a frantic bride rather than use standard shipping and risk being late for their big day.  
[Do you have any phenomenal customer service experiences to share][1]? We're always doing our best to listen to our customers and help wherever we can. Inspiring stories could change the way we deal with our customers.  
Many thanks,  
John Owens, Aspose Scotland Team Leader

Technical Article – Using Web Services to Create Barcodes with Aspose.BarCode for .NET

Web services allow you to integrate software with external applications. Using a standardized request/response model, any client application that can use XML web service can benefit from it. This technical article demonstrates how to create a web service that creates a barcode using Aspose.BarCode for .NET and a WinForms client or a web client. The client application simply sends to string values to the server (codetext and symbology) and Aspose.BarCode takes care of the rest. Read the complete article.

Migration Tip - Migration to Aspose.Words for .NET 9.2 or Higher

Aspose.Words for .NET and Java 10 is coming ever closer. Now is a good time to make sure that your projects are up-to-date and ready for the next step up. We know how annoying it is when an API that you have implemented changes so we try to keep changes down to a minimum. With Aspose.Words for .NET 9.2 we had to make a couple of small changes to make the API better organised and to help the autoporting work we are doing on the Java platform. This article explains the differences and how to update your code. Read the migration tip.
