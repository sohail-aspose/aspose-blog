Aspose.Flash for .NET 2.2.0 has been released. This release supports SWF to FLV conversion and FLV video encoding.

Many customers were demanding video conversion features in Aspose.Flash for .NET. Support for SWF to AVI was already present in Aspose.Flash for .NET and now Aspose.Flash for .NET exposes a new API **RenderToFlv** which can be used to export SWF files to FLV.
