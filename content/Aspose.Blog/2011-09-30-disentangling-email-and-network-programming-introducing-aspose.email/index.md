**Sydney, Australia - 30 September, 2011 -**  Aspose.Network is changing in recognition of how our customers use it. The main change is in the name: our customers use Aspose.Network for email programming so we are changing the name to Aspose.Email.

*   Aspose.Network for Java will be renamed Aspose.Email for Java.
*   Aspose.Network for SharePoint will be renamed Aspose.Email for SharePoint.
*   Aspose.Network for .NET has been split into two products: Aspose.Email for .NET contains email programming features and Aspose.Network for .NET retains the network programming features. There are relatively few networking classes so Aspose.Network for .NET will become a utility. [Aspose.Email for .NET is available for download now][1].

## Why change?

Aspose.Network helped developers program network functionality and manage email. Since its release in 2005, the email features have become increasingly popular and it is these that our customers use Aspose.Network for. We are changing the product to reflect the way it is used and the future development focus for it.

The change makes it easier for existing  and new customers to understand and use the Aspose.Email.

## Introducing Aspose.Email

[![Aspose.Email logo][2]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2011/09/aspose-email-logo1.jpg)Aspose.Email for .NET and Aspose.Email for Java support most major email protocols and contain many utility classes to facilitate common development tasks and makes it easy to work with Microsoft Outlook PST, EML, MSG and MHT files.

Aspose.Email for SharePoint provides email document conversion and synchronization features for files or emails within the Microsoft SharePoint document library or custom lists of emails.

The utility Aspose.Network for .NET enables programmers of ASP .NET web applications, web services and Windows applications to concentrate on their business logic by hiding the complexities of network programming.

## Email management

Aspose.Email allows developers to read and create emails in EML and MSG formats, and convert messages from one format to the other. It includes calendar features, allows you to send and receive emails, manage attachments and HTML formatting, load PST files and get message information. It supports Microsoft outlook but doesn't require you to work with Outlook when programming.

Aspose.Email's features vary from platform to platform. For a complete list of features and benefits, go to the product pages.

**Edit \[14th February, 2012\]:** Aspose.Email for Java is ported automatically from Aspose.Email for .NET using a magical code porting tool which we use internally.
