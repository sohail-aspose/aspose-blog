This release of Aspose.Words for Java features:

*   HTML export (fully matches HTML export available in Aspose.Words for .NET 4.2.1)
*   Updated all other code (all fixes) to match Aspose.Words for .NET 4.2.1.

Still Aspose.Words for Java does not have:

*   HTML import
*   RTF export/import
*   WordML export/import
*   PDF export

We are working on those.
