We are pleased to announce the September release of [Aspose.3D][1] API. It includes long-awaited support for exporting a scene to [HTML][2] format. This feature will enhance the capabilities of your applications and make them truly compatible with many more platforms. Moreover, considering you at the center of our APIs, more control has been shifted towards you by exposing geometric transformation properties. It lets you evaluate global transform, with or without geometric transformation, based on your requirements. For further information, please check the following demonstration in product documentation:

*   [Save 3D Scene as HTML][3]
*   [Geometric Transformation][4]

Moreover, along with the addition of several methods and classes; we have also added properties to scale, translate and rotate the entities. You may please visit [Release Notes (Java)][5] or [Release Notes (.NET)][6] for further information about this release. In case you have any question about Aspose.3D API, you can post your inquiry in [Aspose.3D forums][7].
