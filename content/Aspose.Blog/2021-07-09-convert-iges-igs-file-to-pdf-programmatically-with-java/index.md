IGES files are used to exchange design information between computer-aided design (CAD) applications. You can convert IGES files to PDF programmatically using Java. The following use cases discuss the topic in detail:

*   [IGES to PDF File Converter – Java API Installation][1]
*   [Convert IGES to PDF File Programmatically using Java][2]
*   [Convert IGES to PDF with Advanced Options Programmatically in Java][3]

## IGES to PDF File Converter – Java API Installation {#section1}

[Aspose.CAD for Java][4] API supports working with [IGES][5], [STL][6], [DWG][7], and several other [file formats][8]. You can configure the API by downloading the JAR file from the [Downloads][9] section, or with the following configurations in the pom.xml file of your Maven-based project:

## Convert IGES to PDF File Programmatically using Java {#section2}

You can convert the IGES file to a PDF document with the below steps:

1.  Load input IGES file using [Image][10] class.
2.  Initialize [PdfOptions][11] class object.
3.  Save the output PDF file.

The following code explains how to convert IGES file to PDF document programmatically using Java:

\[gist id="928696a8b451afc499d21ec14df832a8" file="IGES-to-PDF.java"\]

## Convert IGES to PDF with Advanced Options Programmatically in Java {#section3}

PDF file format offers many useful features for document manipulation. For instance, you can set vector rasterization options like the height and width of the page as well as the CAD draw type. You can perform the advanced conversion of IGES file to PDF with the following steps:

1.  Load input IGES file.
2.  Set output PDF options using [CadRasterizationOptions][12] class.
3.  Specify advanced options with [PdfOptions][13] class.
4.  Save the output PDF file with [Save][14] method.

The code below shows how to convert IGS file to a PDF document with advanced options programmatically with Java:

\[gist id="928696a8b451afc499d21ec14df832a8" file="IGES-to-PDF-advanced.java"\]

## Get Free License

You can evaluate the API in its full capacity by requesting a [Free Temporary License][15].

## Conclusion

In conclusion, you have learned how to convert an IGS or IGES file to a PDF document programmatically using Java. Moreover, the API supports advanced conversion options where you can specify different rendering options like the page size of the output PDF file.
