[Aspose.Tasks for .NET][1] 5.4.0 has been released with a number of enhancements and bug fixes. With this month's release, Aspose.Tasks for .NET now supports loading Microsoft Project Template (MPT) files which enables users to create project from constructor using template as parameter. Now Project's constructor can be used to create project from templates and read existing projects as well, avoiding usage of ProjectReader. In this month's release, we have added enhancements to the Gantt chart rendering by providing the option to roll up Gantt bars that marks any summary task in the project by its visible subtasks. In addition, we have also provided the facility to avoid marking non-working time on Gantt chart. The rendering process has also been enhanced to allow printing/hiding of legends on each page. We have also added additional task constraints in this month's release which include StartNoEarlierThan, FinishNoEarlierThan, MustStartOn, and MustFinishOn task constraints. Loading Microsoft This month's release also includes a number of bug fixes related to XML output, where unnecessary data was present as compared to the output by MSP, identifying external tasks, incorrect duration while rendering Gantt chart, and custom fields.
