[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png) We like to share the release announcement of Aspose.Slides for .NET 8.4.0. This is the last release during the transition period in which we maintain both the legacy Aspose.Slides for .NET 8.x.x and the new merged Aspose.Slides for .NET 14.x.x APIs together for one quarter. The support for the legacy Aspose.Slides for .NET (8.x.x series) API will be discontinued after this release and we will only support the new merged Aspose.Slides for .NET (14.x .x series) after this release.

The new merged API provides a single namespace for managing both Microsoft PowerPoint 97 - 2003 and PowerPoint 2007 - 2013 presentation formats.

## Resolved Issues

In this release, we have resolved issues pertaining to rendering SmartArt shapes. Some presentation access issues have also been rectified. Support for chart rendering has been improved and many issues related to missing or improper charts rendering to thumbnails and PDF have been resolved.

We have also enhanced Aspose.Slides' ability to import HTML text into a presentation and exporting from presentation to HTML.
