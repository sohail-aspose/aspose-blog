We have released the Aspose.Cells for Java v2.5.3 for the users.

In this version, we have supported to render Arabic characters in Excel-to-PDF conversion. You may now keep macros when reading/writing ODS files. The users can also detect the file format type when reading Excel files. Moreover, we have supported advanced Arrow shapes and other shapes while rendering sheets to images. It is now possible to get the source data range for a pivot table in the template file. We have also improved the following modules:

*   Reading/Writing Excel 97-2003
*   Reading/Writing Excel 2007
*   Reading/Writing ODS files
*   Smart Markers feature
*   Sheet-to-Image feature
*   Excel-to-PDF feature

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
