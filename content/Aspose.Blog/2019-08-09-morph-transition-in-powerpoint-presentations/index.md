[Aspose.Slides][1] now supports the Morph Transition.  It allows you to create a seamless object animation from one slide to the next. This feature is introduced in **PowerPoint 2019**. You can use this feature to **animate text**, **shapes**, **pictures**, **SmartArt**, **WordArt**, and **charts**. 

**Note:** Morph is supported in **PowerPoint 2019** and **Office 365** and as a transition, it is located in the Transition menu inside of the ribbon.

With Morph, no longer need to use complicated animation sequences which would have been pretty daunting to a non-PowerPoint expert. Morph allows you to create a seamless object animation. It makes your viewers think you created your presentation with advanced video-editing software and not PowerPoint.

If you are willing to think outside the box a little bit, you can create the most magical PowerPoint presentations, and your audience will never think it was done on PowerPoint!

The purpose of this post is to demonstrate how Morph Transition works with [Aspose.Slides][2].

## **How to Set Up a Morph Transition**

To get started with morphing transition effects, you are going to create a base slide first. This is where you add the objects you want to morph. Once you are done with your base slide, you are going to need to duplicate it.

On the duplicated slide, you can move around the objects, you can change the colors, sizes, etc. Basically, what you want your base objects to morph into, that is what you need to do on the duplicated slide. Once you have got your second slide set up, then you can click on Morph and preview the effects.

 In the following example, we have demonstrated how to add a clone of the slide with some text to the presentation and set a transition of morph type to the second slide.

The equivalent [Java][3] implementation for this is as under:

Finally, after adding the Morph Transition, the output looks as follows:
