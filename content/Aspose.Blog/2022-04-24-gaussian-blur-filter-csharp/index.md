Gaussian blur is usually used to smoothen images or to reduce noise. This filter is frequently used by image processing applications. In certain cases, you may need to work with a Gaussian blur filter in your applications. Accordingly, this article covers how to apply the Gaussian blur filter on the images programmatically in C#.

## Work with Gaussian Blur Filter – C# API Installation {#section1}

You need to configure [Aspose.PSD for .NET][3] API either by downloading its DLL file from the [Downloads][4] page, or with the [NuGet][5] installation command below:

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.PSD
```

## Apply Gaussian Blur Filter on an Image Programmatically in C# {#section2}

You can smoothen an image by reducing the noise with the gaussian filter. Please follow the steps below to apply a gaussian blur filter to the images.

*   Firstly, load the input file using the [Image][6] class.
*   Initialize a [GaussianBlurSmartFilter][7] class object.
*   Set different characteristics and apply the blur filter.
*   Finally, save the output image file.

The code sample below explains how to apply the Gaussian blur filter on an image programmatically in C#:

## Explore API Features

There are many other smart filters and operations supported to manipulate the PSD files. You may visit the [documentation][8] space for more information.

## Get a Free Evaluation License

You can request a [free temporary license][9] to test the API in its full capacity.

## Conclusion

In this article, you have learned how to apply a Gaussian filter on an image programmatically using C#. You can also use this filter for the detection of edges, or to produce the drop shadow effect along with many other uses in image processing applications. Likewise, there are many other applications for the Gaussian filter while working with graphics. Moreover, in case of any queries please feel free to reach out to us at the [forum][10].
