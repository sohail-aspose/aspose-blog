If yes, let us know. Please let us know how do you want to use the generated XAML and any other requirements about it.

Current XAML support in Aspose.Words is like this:

1\. Fixed Page. Internal (not visible in the public API) export of each page of the document into fixed page XAML format. Aspose.Words reuses its own XPS output engine for this. We are not quite sure how you would want to use individual XAML pages hence not made it public yet.

2\. Flow. Aspose.Words has a very basic beta of converting a document into a flow XAML format. Available in the public API via the SaveFormat enumeration. We have not yet developed it into a full feature because struggled to find some good usage scenarios.

Use this invitation as an opportunity to get a feature you want.
