We have recently released a new version of Aspose.Network for SharePoint 1.3. This version comes with support for transferring and synchronizing files in the SharePoint 2010 Document Library with Dropbox file sharing services. You can easily select any file(s) from the SharePoint Document Library and send them to Dropbox. And if you prefer automatic synchronization of files from SharePoint to Dropbox and vice versa, you can use the synchronization feature.
