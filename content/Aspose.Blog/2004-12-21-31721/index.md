As part of the effort to make import and export of different file formats using Aspose.Word as best as possible, we've created and will maintain a spreadsheet that documents details of various conversions limitations. At the moment, the spreadsheet only contains details for HTML Import, but we will add the rest of the converters soon. [Aspose.Word.Converters.xls][1]
