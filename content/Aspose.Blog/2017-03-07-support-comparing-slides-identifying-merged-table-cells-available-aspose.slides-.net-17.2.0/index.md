## Resolved Issues

We have rectified the issues related to charts and Ole frame data failing to get opened in edit mode inside PowerPoint for generated presentation. The issues related to URL formatting and tooltip text inside hyperlinks has also been addressed in this release. We have also addressed issues related to improper text rendering including bolding effects, improper color and improper gradient effects.

We have resolved the issues related to presentation access and saving which earlier resulted in exceptions including ArgumentException, NullReferenceException, and PptxReadException in previous releases. We have improved the presentation rendering support in this release and have resolved certain issues related to missing or improper text rendering, missing images, missing charts, and its entities in generated PDF, HTML, and slide thumbnails outputs.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.2.0 Release Notes][3] for further reference.
