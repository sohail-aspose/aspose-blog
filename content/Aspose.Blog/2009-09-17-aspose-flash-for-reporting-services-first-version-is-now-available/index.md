We have released the first version of Aspose.Flash for Reporting Services. I'm very much pleased to share this good news with you. Aspose.Flash for Reporting Services allows you to convert SQL Server Reporting Services Reports into SWF and FLV formats. You can also integrate it with Microsoft Report Viewer. With the addition of this component in the fleet of Aspose Reporting Services products, you have got more flexibility and options to export your reports. Please download the component and try at your end. You can download the MSI package to automatically install and configure the Aspose.Flash for Reporting Services. However, if you like adventure, we have DLL only package as well!  
  
You can see the feature list and download the first version from the [Aspose.Flash for Reporting Services download section][1].
