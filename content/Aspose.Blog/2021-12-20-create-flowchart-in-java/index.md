## Install Java API to Make Flowchart Diagram {#section1}

You can make flowchart diagrams by using the [Aspose.Diagram for Java][3] API. It supports creating or editing Visio files in VSD, VSDX, and other [supported formats][4]. You can easily install the API by downloading the JAR file from the [New Releases][5] section, or using the following Maven specifications:

### Repository```
 <repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>AsposeJavaAPI</id>
        <name>Aspose Java API</name>
        <url>http://repository.aspose.com/repo/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

### Dependency```
 <dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
        <artifactId>aspose-diagram</artifactId>
        <version>22.1</version>
        <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Make Flowchart Programmatically in Java {#section2}

You can make a flowchart for explaining the steps of a sequence. You need to follow the steps below to make flowcharts:

1.  Firstly, create schema for creating the diagram.
2.  Secondly, load a VSS file as master for adding shapes. using the [Diagram][6] class.
3.  Adding shapes and connectors from the schema.
4.  Set layout for the flowchart diagram.
5.  Finally, write the output file with flowchart in VSDX format using [Save][7] method.

The code sample below elaborates how to make a flowchart diagram programmatically in Java:

Moreover, you may like to [download][8] the input and output files to check this feature.

## Get Free API License

You can evaluate all the features of the API without any limitations by requesting a [free temporary license][9].

## Conclusion

In conclusion, you have learned how to create or make flowcharts programmatically using Java. You can customize and change the direction or shapes of the flowchart as per your requirements. So you can easily embed this feature using the API calls from within your Java application. Moreover, you can visit the API [documentation][10] to check several other features of the API. You can ask any of your questions by reaching out at the [forum][11].
