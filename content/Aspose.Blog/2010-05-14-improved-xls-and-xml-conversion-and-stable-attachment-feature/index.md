There have been some customers facing issues while converting Excel worksheets into PDF format, so in order to get these issues resolved, we have made some remarkable improvement in this feature. So now as an upshot, the resultant PDF with the new version is quite similar to the source Excel worksheet. There also have been some issues in the attachment feature and some problems while adding large image files to the PDF document. Not only the above specified issues are resolved but, there has been a fabulous improvement in terms of performance while generating the PDF documents. In fact, this version is 4x-6x times faster than previous version 2.5.0.
