[Aspose.PDF for .NET][1] 6.4.0 allows you to convert PDF files into HTML format. Prior to this release, Aspose.Pdf for .NET supported converting images, XML, HTML, SVG, PCL and XSL-FO files into PDF format but not the other way around.  With this new feature, one single product provides the capability to convert HTML files into PDF or transform PDF files into HTML format.

Since the last release, we have made progress on images and text extraction from PDF files. Aspose.PDf for .NET 6.4 now allows you to extract non-English text such as Arabic, Hebrew etc.  The product is much faster and more stable compared to earlier releases.

We already supported setting security settings while creating the PDF file or applying security settings to an existing document. With the release of Aspose.Pdf for .NET 6.4, we can announce that we now support getting security settings that have already been applied on a PDF file.

To flesh out the security features we offer, you can now specify custom text and image files when adding signatures to PDF documents.

We have also improved how we manage large files. You can now add files larger than 1GB as an attachment to PDF files and concatenating large PDF documents with confidence.

The printing feature has also been improved. PDF pages converted to image files are identical to the source PDF file. The text replacement feature has been updated so that it now supports more complex scenarios and delivers better results.

These are not the only improvements: we have improved how you add watermarks, concatenate PDFs, work with PDF forms, convert HTML to PDF and XML to PDF.

For a complete list of the new features and all fixed issues in this release, please check out [Aspose.PDF for .NET 6.4.0][2].
