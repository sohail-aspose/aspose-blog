[![Aspose.Pdf for Android logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/aspose-Pdf-for-Android.png)We are excited to announce the second release of Aspose.Pdf for Android. This version provides great support for working with images: image extraction, adding images to existing PDFs, replacing images in PDFs, and adding an image as a stamp object. It also allows you to set PDF privileges.

We are working hard to make this product as robust as its siblings on .NET and Java. Please download and evaluate the new capabilities of [Aspose.Pdf for Android 1.1.0][2].
