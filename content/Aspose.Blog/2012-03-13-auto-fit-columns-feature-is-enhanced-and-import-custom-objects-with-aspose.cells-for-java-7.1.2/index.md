We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Cells for Java 7.1.2. This month’s release provides support to create or manage tables in XLS format. You can now import data from custom objects for POJO. Read more about this in our [Importing Data to Worksheets article][1]. We have also made some enhancements to the [sheet-to-PDF][2] feature.

We have made enhancements to the auto-fitting columns feature and have fixed some bugs to do with charts and shapes.
