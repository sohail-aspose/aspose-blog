New v.1.2.0 of Aspose.Words for SharePoint has just came out.  
  
To download it please visit [http://www.aspose.com/community/files/73/sharepoint-components/aspose.words-for-sharepoint/default.aspx][1].  
The major improvement in this release is the support of files concatenation. Any combination of input files in different formats can be simultaneously converted into desired format and combined into the single document. You can manually use it via simple UI in our converter or include it into your own solution by means of our public API which is also quite simple.  
  
Also this release includes fix for known issue with installation on x64 servers. If you unsuccessfully tried before to install Aspose.Words for SharePoint on Windows Server 2008 x64, please try our new release.  
  
Please use our [forum][2] to ask any questions you might have.  
  
Enjoy!
