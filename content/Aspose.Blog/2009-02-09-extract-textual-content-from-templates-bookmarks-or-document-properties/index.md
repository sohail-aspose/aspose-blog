## About Germo



{{< figure align=center src="images/Screenshot-2020-04-24-at-12.02.37-AM-1024x241.png" alt="">}}


[GERMO GmbH][1] offers a variety of software solutions in the field of electronic forms, output management, and document management for health insurance funds. The software suite winEFW (_windows Elektronisches Formularwesen, german for windows electronic template management)_ offers template management, template creation, and administrative functions as well as functions for document creation. To support template administrators during their workflow, winEFW includes a search module providing a great variety of search options for template administrators and editors.

The search includes full-text search as well as search for bookmarks or document properties within Microsoft Word documents and templates.  
The search module was originally written in C++ using COM to access the templates. Within the product lifecycle, the customerâ€™s template portfolio increased from a few hundred templates to more than 3000 templates by now. The increasing numbers of templates led to an unacceptable deterioration within the search process.

## Requirements Scenario

Within a product upgrade, GERMO GmbH decided to reengineer the search module from scratch as a JAVA desktop application. In order to fulfill customer requirements, the search module needs to provide the following functions:

*   Significantly improved search performance
*   Access to the content of the template or document
*   Access to the [bookmarks of the templates][2]
*   Access to the [custom document properties][3]
*   Moderate hardware requirements
*   Independency from a Microsoft Word installation

## Solution Implementation

The evaluation of the available libraries showed that [Aspose.Words for Java][4] perfectly matched our requirements. [Aspose.Words for Java][5] has been used to [extract textual content][6] from our custom templates as well as [bookmarks][7] or [custom document properties][8]. The significant increase in processing speed allowed our customers to retrieve their requested information in a very efficient way and therefore gain a great increase in performance.

## Benefits

[Aspose.Words for Java][9] offers a smart solution to implement document access within applications and supports the developers with widespread [documentation][10] and [comprehensive source examples][11].

[Aspose.Words for Java][12] possess an excellent performance leaving the current COM-based implementation far behind. A .NET sibling of API (_[Aspose.Words for .NET][13]_) is also available and can make potential migrations to .NET very handy.

## Future Implementations

GERMO GmbH is currently developing tools for server-side creation of form letters using [Aspose.Words for .NET][14] and [Aspose.PDF for .NET][15] within a .NET environment. During the evaluation with the [trial version][16], [Aspose][17] provided a very fast document creation process. Therefore, GERMO GmbH decided to use [Aspose][18] tools for ancillary products.

## Conclusion

By using [Aspose.Words for Java][19], we achieved major progress in our daily work and we therefore highly recommend it to prospective customers.
