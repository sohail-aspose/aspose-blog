## About Addatech ClinicMaster



{{< figure align=center src="images/clinicmaster-logo-new-en.png" alt="">}}


Addatech ClinicMaster is a comprehensive, practice management tool that allows users to be in complete control of every aspect of their clinic. ClinicMaster boasts the following features:

*   A comprehensive scheduler.
*   Detailed billing.
*   Referral management system.
*   Cancellation reductions.
*   Improved patient communication.
*   Business process streamlining.
*   Data consolidation.
*   Administrative cost reductions.
*   Productivity, workload, and treatment tracking.

## Requirements

A common feature requested by many [ClinicMaster][1] users is the ability to quickly merge Microsoft Word documents with data residing in the primary database. The majority of documents are official government forms that require electronic submission and must be archived for audit purposes. A solution that would meet this requirement in a cost-effective and efficient manner was necessary. Amongst the platforms considered, the following were the top contenders:

*   [Aspose.Words][2]
*   Microsoft Office Automation
*   Microsoft Office Primary Interop Assemblies (PIA)
*   Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Tools for Microsoft Office (VSTO)

## Solution

Having performed extensive research as well as numerous performance and analysis metrics, [Aspose.Words][3] was chosen as the undisputed winner. Using the Aspose.Words Mail Merge Engine, ClinicMaster now creates merged documents with incredible speed and accuracy. This functionality is now an integral part of ClinicMaster and has been implemented throughout the product suite. Generating documents is as easy as right-clicking a data source entity (dossier, patient, service, therapist), selecting a document (template), and saving the merged document.

## Experience

[Aspose.Words for .NET][4] is a lightweight, .NET component and, as such, takes full advantage of the many benefits offered by the .NET Framework such as managed code execution, garbage collection, structured exception handling, and security features. Aspose.Words is completely independent of Microsoft Word and, as a result, is a cost-effective solution as it eliminates expensive licensing requirements.

Other key features of Aspose.Words include the following:

*   Superior performance.
*   Scalable architecture.
*   Minimal learning curve.
*   Comprehensive documentation.
*   Detailed C# and VB.NET code samples.
*   Intuitive installation process.
*   Simple deployment model (XCopy).
*   Royalty-free distribution (Developer OEM Subscription)

## Next Steps

Addatech Systems is currently exploring the possibility of combining Aspose.Words, [Aspose.PDF][5], and Aspose.Pdf.Kit to provide mail merge functionality for Adobe PDF files. In view of the fact that Aspose.Words was designed to scale to the web server and web service contexts, it is also being considered for implementation in the upcoming ClinicMaster Web Portal (ASP.NET 2.0) as well as web-based, data consolidation modules. These implementations will allow users to dynamically create merged documents (invoices, appointment reminders, confirmations, reports, etc.), using templates and data warehoused on remote Microsoft SQL Server 2005 databases. When combined with web services and COM Interoperability, Aspose.Words allows the developer to architect solutions that bridge legacy systems with their modern counterparts.

## Summary

Developing, debugging, and deploying Office Automation, PIA, and VSTO based solutions can be a daunting task; even for the experienced developer. Fortunately, this is not the case with Aspose.Words. Within minutes, developers will be well on their way to harnessing the full power of Aspose.Words including mail merge functionality, dynamic document creation, and content manipulation; each of these aspects is fully entrusted to the developer.

[Aspose][6] provides some of the best technical support in the business – prompt, professional, attentive and innovative. When coupled with constant product updates, forums, blogs, knowledgebase, online documentation, updated code samples, a flexible licensing model, free product upgrades, and reasonable pricing, choosing Aspose.Words is the only choice.
