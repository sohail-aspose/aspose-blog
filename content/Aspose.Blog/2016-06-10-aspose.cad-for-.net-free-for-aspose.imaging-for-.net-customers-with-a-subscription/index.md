The CAD feature set from Aspose.Imaging for .NET has been extracted to form its own[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/06/Aspose.CAD-Logo-Medium.png) product â€“ Aspose.CAD for .NET. Within the next month or so CAD related features will be removed from Aspose.Imaging for .NET and will be available only in Aspose.CAD for .NET.

As per [our policy on product migrations][2] such as in this case, any customer with an active subscription to Aspose.Imaging for .NET can use Aspose.CAD for .NET free of charge up until their subscription expires. This ensures any customers using CAD features from Aspose.Imaging will still be able to access improvements to this feature set now maintained in Aspose.CAD without any extra cost or disruption.

To get started with Aspose.CAD for .NET simply [download the latest version of the product][3] and then use your active Aspose.Imaging license to activate the product. Aspose.CAD for .NET will accept an Aspose.Imaging license until your subscription expires, or until 12 months from the initial release of Aspose.CAD for .NET (whichever one occurs first).

During renewal time you will need to decide based on your requirements to obtain both Aspose.Imaging for .NET and Aspose.CAD for .NET, or just one of the products instead.

If you need any help while renewing your subscription, please [contact our sales team for assistance][4].
