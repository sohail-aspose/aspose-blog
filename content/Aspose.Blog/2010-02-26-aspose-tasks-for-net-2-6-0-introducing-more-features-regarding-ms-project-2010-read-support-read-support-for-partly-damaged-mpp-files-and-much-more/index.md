Dear Customers,

We are pleased to announce the new release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET 2.6.0. In this release, we have added read support for Task Links, Resources and Resource Assignments for MS Project 2010 MPP files. In addition, we have added functionality for defining the MPP file format and MS Project version without file reading along with read functionality for partly damaged MPP files. Moreover, a number of identified bugs have also been fixed in this release.
