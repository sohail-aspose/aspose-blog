[Aspose.Email for .NET][1] 2.6.0 has been released. With the release of this version, one can now filter messages using the MessageID of an email from an Exchange server. For this purpose, the MailQueryBuilder class has been equipped with the MessageID filter that can be used in combination of other filters to get the desired results.

This month's release also includes a number of important bug fixes, reported by our users,Â related to how Aspose.Email manages PSTs. In addition, other bug fixes such as EML-to-MSG conversion, handling an email's TextBody and retrieving the real mail recipients from a message on Exchange server have been added.

To get further details about what's new and fixed, read the release notes on the [Aspose.Email for .NET][2] release page.
