[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for .NET 14.7.0. This is a maintenance release whereby we have addressed several issues that have been reported recently. The main focus has been to improve issues with access and saving files as well as slide transitions and rendering issues.

## New Features

We have introduced support for improved slide animations and transition effects in a presentation. We have also introduced support for cloning or serializing shapes within presentation slides. Now, it is possible to replicate shapes from a source slide by adding or inserting them into a target slide shape collection. For more details about shape cloning, please visit the documentation article Cloning Shapes in Slides.

## Resolved Issues

We have rectified issues pertaining to presentation accessing and saving which resulted in exceptions like NullReference, ArgumentException, IndexOutOfRange while using older product versions.

We have also improved slide transition and animations effects in this release. We have resolved issues like missing transition effects, wrong transition effect, loss of animation effects and change of direction in slide transition effects for saved presentations.

We have enhanced chart support in this release and have resolved issues related to setting the chart category direction, formatting chart labels, setting font related properties for different chart entities and radar chart support.

The text rendering inside placeholders and tables has also been improved in this release. We have rectified certain issues related to text rendering in this regard.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please visit the documentation article Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for .NET 14.7.0 for further reference.
