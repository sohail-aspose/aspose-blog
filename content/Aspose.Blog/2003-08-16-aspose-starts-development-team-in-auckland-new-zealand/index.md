**August 16, 2003 – Australia, Sydney –** After 16 months in business, Aspose needs to grow to meet demand for its products. Roman Korchagin will lead a new team, based in Auckland, New Zealand. We look forward to seeing the Auckland team grow and help us succeed.

Quality and customer focus is what is important to us, not location. When we look for talent, we do not just look for it locally. Aspose may have headquarters in Australia, but we want to work with the best developers and the most committed sales people wherever we can find them.

The technologies that we work with frees us to consider staff from all over the world. We depend on communication technologies to communicate within the organization and with our customers. A professional and open approach makes it work.

You can find out about Aspose’s latest openings on the [Careers pages][1] on our website.
