**Technical Tip**

**Convert documents to different formats**  
  
One of the important features of [Aspose.Words][12] for .NET is extensive support of DOC, RTF, WordprocessingML and HTML import & export. You can convert documents between any of these formats using just two lines of code. DOC, RTF and WordprocessingML are Microsoft Word document formats. Aspose.Words supports these formats to a very high degree and therefore conversions between these formats in any direction are very precise. No document content or formatting is lost during such conversions. Aspose.Words can be used in a server or client application, single threaded or multi-threaded.  
  
**\[C#\]**  
  
// Convert from RTF to DOC  
Aspose.Words.Document doc = new Document("C:\\\\MyFolder\\\\MyFile.rtf");  
doc.Save("C:\\\\MyFolder\\\\MyFile.doc");  
  
// Convert from HTML to RTF  
Aspose.Words.Document doc = new Document("C:\\\\MyFolder\\\\MyFile.html");  
doc.Save("C:\\\\MyFolder\\\\MyFile.rtf");

// Convert from DOC to WordML  
Aspose.Words.Document doc = new Document("C:\\\\MyFolder\\\\MyFile.doc");  
doc.Save("C:\\\\MyFolder\\\\MyFile.xml");  
   
// And so on.  
  
**\[VB\]**  
  
' Convert from RTF to DOC  
Dim doc As Aspose.Words.Document =  New Document("C:\\\\MyFolder\\\\MyFile.rtf")  
doc.Save("C:\\\\MyFolder\\\\MyFile.doc")  
   
' Convert from HTML to RTF  
Dim doc As Aspose.Words.Document =  New Document("C:\\\\MyFolder\\\\MyFile.html")  
doc.Save("C:\\\\MyFolder\\\\MyFile.rtf")  
   
' Convert from DOC to WordML  
Dim doc As Aspose.Words.Document =  New Document("C:\\\\MyFolder\\\\MyFile.doc")  
doc.Save("C:\\\\MyFolder\\\\MyFile.xml")  
   
' And so on.
