# A brief history of Aspose.Words

In 2003, Aspose saw the product which developed into Aspose.Cells gain in popularity. It was a practical .NET component that gave developers a way of working with XLS files. Extending the idea to DOC files seemed natural. Ben Li, Team Leader for Aspose Sydney, says "_We had an idea for a product, but we were still a small team and we didn't have the resource. We had worked with Roman on a different project so I asked him if he wanted to develop Aspose.Words._"

Roman Korchagin, Team Leader for Aspose Auckland, continues: "_Aspose.Words was – and still is – an interesting challenge. That first version was nowhere near as advanced as the current product but it quickly became popular._" Roman has been involved in Aspose.Words from that very first release, written entirely by him. Over the years, the team has grown, many new features have been added and the product has been ported to another four platforms.

*   **2003**: Aspose.Words 1.0 for .NET is released in December after four months of development. The product supported DOC files only and had features for mail merge and mail merge with regions. It had a simple public API for working with bookmarks and sections.
*   **2004**: Aspose.Words 2.0 for .NET sees support for HTML and export to PDF through Aspose.Pdf. It also introduces the first of the image and shape support that makes Aspose.Words such a flexible product.
*   **2005**: By version 3.0 of Aspose.Words for .NET, six people are working on the product. The tree-like DOM is introduced and work on porting the product to Java begins.
