We like to announce the release of [Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services][1] 5.1.0.

We have enhanced the support for the latest version of SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) in Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services. Now, you can also install and configure Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services with SSRS 2014. We have also resolved issues like missing Aspose.Slides export options in report server and improved rendering performance in this release.

We have improved the report rendering to the presentation. We have resolved issues like improper rendering of carriage returns and content spilling out of the exported presentation slides when rendering reports using earlier versions of Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services.

To see a complete list of fixes and to download Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 5.1.0, please visit the [download page][2].
