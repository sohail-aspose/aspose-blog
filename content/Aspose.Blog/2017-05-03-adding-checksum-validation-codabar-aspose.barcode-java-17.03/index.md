[](https://www.aspose.com/products/barcode/java)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Barcode for Java 17.3. This monthâ€™s release provides the capability to [add checksum validation on Codabar][1] coded barcode. An enhancement has also been made in this version to control fake/additional recognition of DutchKIX while MaxBarCodes mode is applied. Other than above mentioned new features, the API also fixes several bugs reported in the last version by the customers.

## Adding Checksum Validation On Codabar

Aspose.BarCode for Java allows developers to [add checksum validation on Codabar][2] barcode. The API now exposes the CodabarChecksumMode enumeration to specify the checksum mode. BarCodeBuilder class has a property setEnableChecksum that needs to be set to **TRUE** before setting the checksum mode. Following code illustrates how to set this property and use the checksum enumeration.

```
 //Generation
//Instantiate BarCodeBuilder object
com.aspose.barcode.BarCodeBuilder builder = new com.aspose.barcode.BarCodeBuilder();
        
//Set the Code text for the barcode
builder.setCodeText("1234567890");
        
//Set the symbology type to CodaBar
builder.setEncodeType(com.aspose.barcode.EncodeTypes.CODABAR);
        
//Set the EnableChecksum property to yes
builder.setEnableChecksum(com.aspose.barcode.EnableChecksum.Yes);
        
//Set the CodabarChecksumMode
builder.setCodabarChecksumMode(com.aspose.barcode.CodabarChecksumMode.Mod10);
        
//Save the image on the system
builder.save("Codabar_Mod10.png");

//Recognition
//Initialize reader object
BarCodeReader reader = new BarCodeReader("Codabar_Mod10.png", com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.DecodeType.CODABAR);
        
//Set ChecksumValidation property of the reader to On
reader.setChecksumValidation(com.aspose.barcode.barcoderecognition.ChecksumValidation.On);
while (reader.read())
{
      //Get code text
      System.out.println(" codetext: " + reader.getCodeText());
            
      //Get type of barcode
      System.out.println(" type: " + reader.getCodeType());
            
      //Get checksum value
      System.out.println(" Checksum: " + reader.getCheckSum());
} 
```

## Enhancements

Complete list of enhancements and fixes in this release is as follows.

*   Functionality to recognize barcode with checksum has been improved.
*   New changes have been incorporated into the detection algorithm to read GS1DataMatrix barcode.
*   Improved the functionality to not detect fake/additional DutchKIX coded barcode.
