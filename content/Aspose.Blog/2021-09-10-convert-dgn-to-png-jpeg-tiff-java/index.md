## Convert DGN File to JPEG Image Programmatically with Java {#section2}

You can convert a DGN file to a JPEG image with the below steps:

1.  Load input DGN file using [Image][8] class.
2.  Create an instance  of [CadRasterizationOptions][9] type.
3.  Initialize an object of [JpegOptions][10] class.
4.  Convert DGN to JPG image.

The following code explains how can you convert a DGN file to a JPEG image programmatically using Java:

## Convert DGN to PNG Image Programmatically using Java {#section3}

You can convert a DGN file to a PNG image with the steps below:

1.  Load input DGN file with [Image][11] class.
2.  Create an instance of [CadRasterizationOptions][12] and set image height & width.
3.  Convert DGN to PNG Image.

The following code demonstrates how to convert a DGN file to a PNG image programmatically using Java:

## DGN to TIFF Image Conversion Programmatically in Java {#section4}

You can easily convert a DGN file to a TIFF image with following steps:

1.  Load input DGN file using [Image][13] class.
2.  Initialize an instance object of [CadRasterizationOptions][14] class.
3.  Specify an object of [TiffOptions][15] type.
4.  Convert DGN to TIFF format image.

The following code elaborates how to convert a DGN file to a TIFF image programmatically in Java:
