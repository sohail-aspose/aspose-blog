Almost a month ago, we shared with you guys about the upcoming launch of our new set of [Aspose.Email APIs][1]. Of these, we are pleased to announce the launch of [Aspose.Email for Android via Xamarin][2]. The addition of this new API to [Aspose.Email product family][3] further expands the list of platforms supported. It is one of the APIs that we were in process to launch for working with Android, iOS and Mac via Xamarin. This new API lets you develop native Android applications with Xamarin that are rich in emailing features. 

## Where to get the API from?

Aspose.Email for Android via Xamarin is available for download as a zip package from the API’s [download page][4]. You can also install the API from Aspose.Email for Android via Xamarin [Nuget package][5].

## Getting Started with Aspose.Email for Android via Xamarin

Aspose.Email for Android via Xamarin  available in the form of DLL. After setting up with Xamarin environment in Microsoft Visual Studio, include reference to the API DLL in your project. That’s it. You are good to go with getting started with the API functionality.

## API Features

 Aspose.Email for Android via Xamarin contains almost all the [features][6] as are supported by Aspose.Email for .NET with some differences. These features include:

*   Working with several popular message formats including EML, EMLx, and Outlook MSG file format
*   Work with and manipulate Outlook MSG properties
*   Inter conversion between message formats
*   Working with Outlook Calendar, Contacts, Notes and Tasks items
*   Support for Outlook PST and OST storage files
*   Complete support for SMTP, POP3 and IMAP protocols for sending and receiving emails
*   Support for Exchange server protocols including WebDav and EWS
*   Ability to work with MBox storage files

## Documentation and API Reference Guide

Aspose.Email for Android via Xamarin exhibits the same features set as the Aspose.Email for .NET API. For this reason, we will use Aspose.Email for .NET [documentation][7] and [API Reference guide][8] for this API as well. The .NET API documentation can be referenced for code samples and guidelines other than exceptions listed in following section.

## Limitations

As mentioned earlier, the API contains almost all the features offered by Aspose.Email for .NET. However, there are certain limitations a well. For example:

*   The API doesn’t have any printing features for exporting the messages to TIFF or XPS format
*   ActiveSync client is not available in the API
*   You cannot embed linked images into message body in both RTF as well as HTML format
*   It also has no functionality of Signing or Encrypting/Decrypting messages
*   All Aspose.Email methods taking System.Stream as a parameter require the stream to be seekable and has a length. This may not be the case for some Xamarin Streams. For example, Android Assets and raw Resources are available as streams, but if one will pass such a stream to the Aspose.Email API, it will result in NotSupportedException.

These limitations and work around methods (where applicable) are listed in [API limitations page][9] for Aspose.Email for Andoird via Xamarin.
