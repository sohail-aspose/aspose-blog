![Aspose.Cells icon][1]

We have just released the Aspose.Cells for .NET v7.0.0. In this version, we have made some enhancements regarding Pivot Tables and Smart Markers. You can now change the position of the pivot table items. Aspose.Cellsâ€™ Exception handling is improved a bit and an exception will be thrown when you try to name a worksheet with special characters (that is not allowed in MS Excel either).

You can now render HTML files applied with conditional formatting. The performance of the Formula Calculation Engine is increased, the Auto-Fit Columns feature is also enhanced which works efficiently now.

The grid controls (GridDesktop and GridWeb) provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET, now, support to import Excel files with or without calculated formulas. Moreover, the Comments with images are imported from Excel files.

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
