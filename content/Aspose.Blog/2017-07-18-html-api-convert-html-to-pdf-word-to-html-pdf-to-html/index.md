We are very much excited to announce the first public release of Aspose.Html for .NET. Prior to the release of this API, we already have Aspose.Words for .NET API which primarily offers the capabilities to create as well as manipulate existing MS Word files. It also provides the capabilities to [convert HTML to PDF while loading External Resources][1] and it also offers the feature to [Convert MS Word document to HTML with Roundtrip Information][2]. Furthermore, we also have an API named Aspose.Pdf for .NET which is capable of creating as well as manipulating existing PDF documents and it also supports the feature to [convert HTML to PDF - Resource Loading Callback][3] or you can even [convert PDF file to HTML format][4] but both of these APIs do not support the feature to manipulate HTML file and its contents. Therefore in order to cater the requirement to Insert, Remove, Replace HTML nodes, extract CSS style information, Navigate through HTML document either by NodeIterator, TreeWalker that are provided by Traversal Specifications, XPath or CSS selector queries, we have introduced this new API. Apart from earlier mentioned features, this API also offers scripting which allows manipulating HTML DOM via JavaScript. Along with HTML, this API also provides the capabilities to load EPUB and MHTML files.

As mentioned earlier, Aspose.Words and Aspose.Pdf provide the capabilities to render HTML files to PDF format, we have natively provided HTML to PDF rendering support in Aspose.Html for .NET, so that our customers do not have to use multiple APIs when dealing with HTML files and rendering them to PDF format. Please note that Aspose APIs are famous for their inter file format conversion features and this API also provides the capabilities to load HTML file and render the output in XPS and raster image formats including JPEG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF. When generating the output in PDF format, you can also encrypt the document, specify the page setup information for resultant output and we can also specify the compression value for JPEG images inside the output document.
