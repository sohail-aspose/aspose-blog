Project Aspose.Cells Java for Apache POI HSSF and XSSF shows how different tasks can be performed using Aspose.Cells Java API in comparison with Apache POI SS. Aspose.Cells Java for Apache POI SS also covers the features that are only available in Aspose.Cells Java API but not in [Apache POI][1].

### Aspose.Cells for Java

[Aspose.Cells for Java][2] is an Excel® spreadsheet reporting component that enables Java applications to create and manage Excel® spreadsheets without using Microsoft Excel®. Aspose.Cells for Java is an incredibly featured rich component that offers much more than just basic data export functions.

This new release, [Aspose.Cells vs Apache POI SS (HSSF + XSSF) v 1.5][3], shows a number of new code comparison examples of features that are available in both Aspose.Cells Java API and in Apache POI HSSF + XSSF while dealing Microsoft Office Excel and Apache OpenOffice Calc Spreadsheet documents.
