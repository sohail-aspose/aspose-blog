We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Words for .NET and Java 13.2.0. This is the second release which uses the new date-based version numbering system that was introduced at the start of this year. As explained in last month’s release, Aspose.Words now uses a version structure which looks like **<year>.<month>.<hotfix>**.

This month’s release contains over 140 improvements to many areas of Aspose.Words. Two of the biggest features are showcased below. As always you can immediately download our latest Aspose.Words release from the following links:

*   [Aspose.Words for .NET 13.2.0][1]
*   [Aspose.Words for Java 13.2.0][2]

## Rendering 3D and Shadows Effects on Shapes in Word Documents

A shape or image in Microsoft Word document can have advanced effects applied to them, such as shadow, 3D rotation(extrusion), reflection and more. In previous versions Aspose.Words would render shapes with such effect to PDF and similar formats as regular shapes without the effects applied.

Starting with Aspose.Words 13.2.0 we have made big improvements to this area of rendering and now 3D extrusion and simple shadows on shapes are now supported upon rendering.

## Reduction of File Size when Saving Documents with JPEG Images to PDF

We have made some improvements to the way JPEG images are exported to PDF which results in some great file size saving benefits. One test document which contained a few particularly large images had its output PDF size reduced by up to 12 times.
