[![][1]](http://www.aspose.com/java/excel-component.aspx)[![][2]](https://netbeans.org/)Aspose has now integrated the examples of Aspose.Cells for Java code and a features comparison with Apache POI SS (HSSF + XSSF) in [Aspose Project Wizard for NetBeans IDE][3].

After this both Aspose.Words vs Apache POI WP and Aspose.Cells vs Apache POI SS are available in Aspose Project Wizard from version 2.3 and onwards.

With this integration you don't need to manually download the [Aspose Java APIs code comparison examples with Apache POI framework][4] as they are now available through the plugin's Aspose New Example wizard within NetBeans IDE.

Comparison examples shows side by side code comparison for features available in both Aspose.Cells and Apache POI SS (HSSF & XSSF).

## How to Create the Aspose.Cells Features Comparison Example with Apache POI within NetBeans IDE

1.  Create an Aspose application using the Aspose Project wizard (detailed steps are mentioned in previous Aspose blog post). In the wizard, select the Aspose.Cells component like shown in below screenshot:[![][5]](https://downloads.aspose.com/)
2.  Create new **Aspose Example** from **New File** option in NetBeans IDE (detailed steps are mentioned in previous Aspose blog post).
3.  Select Aspose.Cells component from the selection box.  
    Examples will be downloaded and will appear in tree format including Aspose.Cells code comparison examples with Apache POI SS as shown in below image. Select an example from tree and click **Finish**.[![][6]](https://downloads.aspose.com/)
4.  This starts downloading of selected example dependencies, that is, the Apache POI framework library jars.
5.  After the dependencies has downloaded, the selected example is available in your Aspose application within respective package under Source Packages along with Apache POI framework jars.[![][7]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/11/Aspose.Cells-Libs-after-Example-m.png)
