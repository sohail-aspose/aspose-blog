We are proud to announce the new release of Aspose.Network v4.2.0.0. The long-awaited features for Outlook Message Files (\*.msg) Writing have been completed and included in this release. Microsoft Outlook 2003, 2007, and 2008 are supported well.

Another exciting feature in this release is that the Email Message Files (\*.eml) is able to convert to Outlook Message Files (\*.msg).

You can now easily do the file format conversion in 1 line of code:

_MapiMessage.FromMailMessage("sample.eml").Save("sample.msg");_

For detail documentation of writing outlook message (msg) files, refer to http://www.aspose.com/documentation/utility-components/aspose.network-for-.net/creatingsaving-outlook-message-msg-files.html and for eml to msg conversion, please refer to http://www.aspose.com/documentation/utility-components/aspose.network-for-.net/eml-to-msg-converter.html.
