We have an office conveniently located in Boiling Springs, SC, and we service customers in the entire Upstate of South Carolina and all of Western North Carolina. 

## About the Product

Our product had a Narrative report template that was in Word 2007 format. We needed a control that shall allow us to populate this template with user-specific information and display this information on a web page. The information displayed came from records in Microsoft SQL 2008.

## Requirements

We were looking for a control that shall work with Word 2007 and Adobe PDF formats. We needed to be able to populate scoring information within a 48-page document. The font and display of this information were important. We needed to be able to have the source information from Microsoft SQL 2008 to be displayed within our document.

## Solution

We used [Aspose.Words for .NET][2] product to make calls to the Word document and populate the necessary fields. We were able to bring in the record information from Microsoft SQL 2008 and place the information within the document. Once the document was assembled, we displayed this information to the browser in a PDF format.

## Experience

[Aspose.Words for .NET][3] helped us to generate the required information and displayed that information in a user-friendly, simple to read method. It enabled us to view this unique record with the embedded explanation within the browser in PDF format.

## Future Implementations

[Aspose][4] is where we will start to look for .NET control in the future.

## Conclusion

This control was easy to use. The [Aspose.Words for .NET][5] allowed us to create the unique score specific document with the needed information and explanation. [Aspose’s support team][6] was easy to reach and very helpful. The example code provided was also easy to follow.

In this section of the document, we were able to place X in the appropriate section of the chart to show the relationship of scores.
