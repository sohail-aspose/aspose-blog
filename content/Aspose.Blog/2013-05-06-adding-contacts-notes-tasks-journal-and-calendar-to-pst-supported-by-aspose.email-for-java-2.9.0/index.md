[![Aspose.Email for Java][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/02/aspose.email-logo120.jpg)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Email for Java 2.9.0 that includes a number of new features and bug fixes.

As Aspose.Email for Java is autoported from its equivalent .NET version, any new feature implemented in the .NET version is available automatically in the ported Java version. Aspose.Email for Java 2.9.0 now supports adding contacts, notes, tasks, calendar, and journal items to PST files in the same way as messages are added to PST.Â   
We have also fixed a number of bugs, reported earlier by our valued customers and users, in this month's release. Issues related to email conversion to other formats such as MHTML, saving image from a VCard, processing ICS files, creating PSTs with a large number of email messages, saving attachments from message using stream and some exceptions.

To get further details about what's new & fixed, read the release notes on the [Aspose.Email for Java][2] release page.
