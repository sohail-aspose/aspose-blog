[Aspose.Email for Java 17.8][1] has been published. Ported from its equivalent [.NET version][2], this month’s release includes the same enhancements and improvements. Specifically, it provides complete support for working with Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 using EWS. It also supports conversion of email messages to HTML without embedding message resources in output file. For a complete list of all the changes included in this version, please visit the [release notes][3] section of Aspose.Email for Java API documentation.

# Major Features

**Support for Microsoft Exchange Server 2016:** We are glad to share that Aspose.Email for Java API now provides complete support for working with Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 using its EWS client. This was earlier limited by certain features where the API didn’t support the functionality completely. With this month’s release, you can now get benefit of working with all the functionality of Exchange Server 2016.

**Conversion of Messages without Embedding Resources in Output:** Aspose.Email for Java API lets you convert messages to HTML. This month’s version further enhances this functionality by saving message resources (attachments, inline images, etc.) to user defined destination. This allows to [save the message resources][4] without embedding into the output html file. This is as illustrated in the following code sample.
