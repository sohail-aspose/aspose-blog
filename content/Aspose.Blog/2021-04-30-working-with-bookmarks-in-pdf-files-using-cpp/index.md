## C++ API for Working with Bookmarks in PDF Files {#CPP-API-for-Working-with-Bookmarks-in-PDF-Files}

[Aspose.PDF for C++][12] is a C++ library that allows you to create, read and update PDF documents. Furthermore, the API supports adding, reading, modifying, and removing bookmarks from PDF files. You can either install the API through [NuGet][13] or download it directly from the [downloads][14] section.

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.PDF.Cpp
```

## Add Bookmarks in PDF Files using C++ {#Add-Bookmarks-in-PDF-Files-using-CPP}

The following are the steps to add a bookmark in a PDF file.

*   Firstly, create an instance of the [PdfBookmarkEditor][15] class.
*   Load the PDF document using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->BindPdf(System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Pdf::Document> srcDoc)][16] method.
*   Create the bookmark using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->CreateBookmarkOfPage(System::String bookmarkName, int32\_t pageNumber)][17] method.
*   Save the PDF document using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->Save(System::String destFile)][18] method.

The following sample code demonstrates how to add a bookmark in a PDF file using C++.

## Add Nested Bookmarks in PDF Files {#Add-Nested-Bookmarks-in-PDF-Files}

You can also add nested bookmarks using the Aspose.PDF for C++ API. The following are the steps for adding nested bookmarks.

*   Create an instance of the [PdfBookmarkEditor][19] class.
*   Load the PDF document using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->BindPdf(System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Pdf::Document> srcDoc)][20] method.
*   Create bookmarks using the [Bookmark][21] class.
*   Add the child bookmarks to the instance of the [Bookmarks][22] class and set it as a child of the parent bookmark using the [bookmark->set\_ChildItems(System::SharedPtr<Bookmarks> value)][23] method.
*   Add the bookmarks to the PDF document using [PdfBookmarkEditor->CreateBookmarks(System::SharedPtr<Bookmark> bookmark)][24] method.
*   Finally, save the PDF document using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->Save(System::String destFile)][25] method.

The following sample code shows how to add nested bookmarks in a PDF file using C++.

## Read Bookmarks from a PDF File using C++ {#Read-Bookmarks-from-a-PDF-File-using-CPP}

In order to read the bookmarks, use the [PdfBookmarkEditor->ExtractBookmarks()][26] method. The following are the steps to read bookmarks from a PDF file.

*   Create an instance of the [PdfBookmarkEditor][27] class.
*   Load the PDF document using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->BindPdf(System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Pdf::Document> srcDoc)][28] method.
*   Retrieve all bookmarks using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->ExtractBookmarks()][29] method.
*   Loop through the bookmarks to retrieve individual bookmarks.
*   Read the properties of the bookmarks.

The following sample code shows how to read bookmarks from a PDF file using C++.

{{< gist aspose-com-gists c6b5dde772d239f66bb02be882a76693 "Read-Bookmarks.cpp" >}}

## Modify Bookmark Title using C++ {#Modify-Bookmark-Title-using-CPP}

The following are the steps to modify the title of an existing bookmark in a PDF file.

*   Create an instance of the [PdfBookmarkEditor][30] class.
*   Load the PDF document using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->BindPdf(System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Pdf::Document> srcDoc)][31] method.
*   Modify the title of the bookmark using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->ModifyBookmarks(System::String sTitle, System::String dTitle)][32] method.
*   Save the PDF document using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->Save(System::String destFile)][33] method.

The following sample code demonstrates how to modify the title of an existing bookmark in a PDF file.

## Delete a Particular Bookmark using C++ {#Delete-a-Particular-Bookmark-using-CPP}

The API provides the [PdfBookmarkEditor->DeleteBookmarks(System::String title)][34] method to delete a particular bookmark from a PDF file. The following are the steps to delete a specific bookmark.

*   Create an instance of the [PdfBookmarkEditor][35] class.
*   Load the PDF document using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->BindPdf(System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Pdf::Document> srcDoc)][36] method.
*   Delete the desired bookmark using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->DeleteBookmarks(System::String title)][37] method.
*   Save the PDF document using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->Save(System::String destFile)][38] method.

The following sample code shows how to delete a particular bookmark using C++.

{{< gist aspose-com-gists c6b5dde772d239f66bb02be882a76693 "Delete-Particular-Bookmark.cpp" >}}

## Delete all Bookmarks in a PDF File using C++ {#Delete-all-Bookmarks-in-a-PDF-File-using-CPP}

Instead of deleting bookmarks one at a time, you can remove all the bookmarks at once using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->DeleteBookmarks()][39] method. The following are the steps to delete all bookmarks in a PDF file.

*   Create an instance of the [PdfBookmarkEditor][40] class.
*   Load the PDF document using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->BindPdf(System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Pdf::Document> srcDoc)][41] method.
*   Delete all the bookmarks using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->DeleteBookmarks()][42] method.
*   Save the PDF document using the [PdfBookmarkEditor->Save(System::String destFile)][43] method.

The following is the sample code to delete all bookmarks in a PDF file.
