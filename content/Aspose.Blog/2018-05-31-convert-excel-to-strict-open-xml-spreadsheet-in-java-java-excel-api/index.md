We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Cells for Java 18.5][1]. This release includes many new features and enhancements along with some critical bug fixes that further improve the overall stability of the APIs. We also recommend our clients to use the powerful Aspose for Java APIs directly in their Maven Projects with simple configurations. Please check the [release notes][2] in order to get an idea about what is new and what has been fixed with this revision of Aspose.Cells for Java. Here is a look at the major features in this release.

## Save Excel Workbook to Strict Open XML Spreadsheet Format

Aspose.Cells allows you to save the workbook in Strict Open XML Spreadsheet format. For that purpose, it provides the **Workbook.Settings.Compliance** property. If you set its value as **OoxmlCompliance.ISO\_29500\_2008\_STRICT**, then the output Excel file will be saved in Strict Open XML Spreadsheet format.
