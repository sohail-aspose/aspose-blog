[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-Java_100.png) We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Java 8.6.0. This is one of maintenance releases where we have rectified many rendering issues seen in Aspose.Slides for Java.

## Fixes and Improvements

We have improved chart rendering support which previously resulted in missing chart trend lines, missing labels and chart axis values in exported PDF, HTML and slide thumbnails. We have also rectified missing chart and duplicate chart issues in output files.

We have resolved presentation access and saving issues that previously resulted in exceptions. Issues pertaining to slide cloning have also been addressed which previously resulted in NullReference exceptions. We have also taken a step forward towards performance enhancement along with improved performance in multi- threaded environment.

We have improved rendering support for WMF contents and clip arts that failed to render in generated slide thumbnails and PDF files. Text rendering that resulted in text spilling out of slide in exported thumbnail and HTML files has been improved. We have also improved the SmartArt support for SmartArt nodes and child nodes.
