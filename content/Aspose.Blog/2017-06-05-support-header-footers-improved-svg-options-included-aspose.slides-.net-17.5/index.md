We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.5. We have added some new features related to improved Header/Footer support and HTML export options in this release.

## New Features

We have improved the Header/Footer support in Aspose.Slides and now you can set Header/Footer on individual slides level for normal slides, layout slides and master slides. It is pertinent to mention that if Header/Footer is defined on Master slide level then every layout slides and their respective normal slides shall inherit the same Header/Footer properties. Please visit documentation articles, [Setting Footer Visibility inside Slide][1] and [Setting Child Footer Visibility inside Slide][2] for further details. We have also improved the HTML export for presentation by providing custom controller to embed fonts. Please visit documentation article, [Embed All Fonts When Converting Presentation to HTML][3]. Now, you can also export the slides to SVG by setting custom shape IDs that can be used by developers in their processing of exported SVG. Please visit the documentation article, Generating an SVG with Custom Shape IDs.

## Resolved Issues

We have improved presentation rendering support in this API and have rectified issues related to text, images, charts and other shapes rendering inside exported TIFF, PDF and slide thumbnails. We have also addressed the issues related to text in saved presentations including text height getting changed issue and broken text issue inside paragraphs.

We have improved the charting support and have resolved issues related to adding Doughnut charts. We have also resolved the issues related to presentation access and saving which earlier resulted in different exceptions like, ArgumentNullException, NullReferenceException and NullPointerException.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.5 Release Notes][4] for further reference.
