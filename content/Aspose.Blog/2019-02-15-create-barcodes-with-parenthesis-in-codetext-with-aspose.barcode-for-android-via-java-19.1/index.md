We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.BarCode for Android via Java 19.1][1]. This release enhanced the **BarCodeGenerator** API to support parenthesis in the **CodeText**. For a detailed note on what is new and fixed, please visit the [release notes][2] page for information of API documentation.

## Add Parenthesis in Barcode's Code Text

This release of Aspose.BarCode enhanced the **BarCodeGenerator** API to allow the **CodeText** to contain parenthesis. You may generate barcodes with parenthesis in the **CodeText** as shown below in the code example. 

```
com.aspose.barcode.generation.BarCodeGenerator generator =   
new com.aspose.barcode.generation.BarCodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.PDF\_417);  
  
generator.setCodeText("Sample.Code.Text(Example).20181203\_150435");  
generator.save(TestDirectory + "barcodeTest2.png", BarCodeImageFormat.PNG);
```
