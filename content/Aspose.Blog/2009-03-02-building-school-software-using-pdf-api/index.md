## About Just5clicks

We have used [Aspose.PDF for .NET][1] API extensively in our ASP.NET web application. We wrote software for school districts where we had the following modules: data warehouse, progress card, report card, reporting system, online test-taking, bubble sheet generation, and scanning. We used [Aspose.PDF For .NET][2] for **report generation**, **progress/report card generation**, and **bubble sheet/rubric generation**.

## Scenario Requirements

*   Ability to [stream bitmap images to PDF][3], (_to have an export functionality in our online charts_).
*   Ability to [create tabular reports on the fly][4] based on reporting logic in our application.
*   Ability to [create large PDF documents][5] quickly.
*   Ability to create bubble sheets based on [3rd party bubble fonts and barcode fonts][6].
*   Availability of [online examples][7] and [Knowledgebase][8].

## Solution Implementation

Initially, we used a 3rd party component to generate charts, but they did not provide the functionality to export the charts to PDF. We streamed a bitmap image to [Aspose.PDF for .NET][9] and it easily generated a PDF document for us. Some of our reports had multiple charts and were run on each student in a class. So in that scenario, we generated a page for each student and/or chart. An example of this has been an annual report that the School Board uses while making decisions.

We also used [Aspose.PDF for .NET][10] to [generate tabular reports][11] that were custom by customers. Sometimes the reports were comprised of hundreds of pages and [Aspose.PDF for .NET][12] API generated such huge PDF files quickly when compared to other competing components. An example has been a take-home report that was generated for each student in a class and it contained a number of charts and tabular reports.

Apart from this, some of our clients used our progress card module. We typically had multiple templates per grade and we used [Aspose.PDF for .NET][13] to dynamically generate all of these templates based on configuration tables.

We also used [Aspose.PDF for .NET][14] to generate bubble sheets for students and teachers to input answers or scores for local assessments. We then generated a PDF document that had a page for each student with an appropriate number of bubbles on it. Each bubble corresponded to the number of questions on the test. The district was then able to print out these bubble sheets on any printer and they were later scanned and scored by our software. In addition to simple bubble sheets, we also had the ability to add rubrics to the PDF document.

## Benefits

[Aspose.PDF for .NET][15] gave us the functionality and interfaces we required which were not present in other PDF generation components that we evaluated. Furthermore, while we reviewed the features of [Apose.PDF for .NET][16], it also gave us some ideas on how to implement new processes and reports.

We have used the [product support][17] many times and we have been very satisfied with the level of support we have received.

## Future Implementations

We will continue to add new features to our software on a daily basis and will keep on using [Aspose.PDF for .NET][18] as a core component.

## Conclusion

  
Overall, we have had a good experience when using and dealing with [Aspose.PDF for .NET][19].
