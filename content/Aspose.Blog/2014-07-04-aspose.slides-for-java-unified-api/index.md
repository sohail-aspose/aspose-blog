[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-Java_100.png) Over the years, the Aspose.Slides product family has been a leading rendering service used to manage PowerPoint presentations in both Office 97-2003 (PPT) and Office 2007-2013 (PPTX) presentation formats. It allows developers to create presentations from scratch and export them to PDF, XPS and other image formats. The existing Aspose.Slides family includes API components for .NET, Java, Android, SQL Reporting Services, SharePoint services, Cloud and Jasper Reports.

## New UnifiedÂ  API for Aspose.Slides for Java

With the growing demands to provide an API for Aspose.Slides for Java that has single namespace for both Office 97-2003 (PPT) and Office 2007-2013 (PPTX) presentation formats, we're proud to share the release announcement of Aspose.Slides for Java 14.4.0. Unlike previous versions of Aspose.Slides for Java, where you have to write different code samples for PPT and PPTX presentation formats, you can now use the same code for both formats. The features support for PPT presentation formats has also been enhanced with this unification.

This release is part of the ongoing process to develop a merged Aspose.Slides for Java API that is at par with the legacy Aspose.Slides for Java 8.x.x series API. The legacy Aspose.Slides for Java API will be phased out once the merged API incorporates all the same features and is fully mature. In the meanwhile, we maintain both the merged and legacy APIs so that our customer can familiarize themselves with the new API.

In this release, we have added support for loading, saving, editing, and rendering 2D SmartArt objects. Our documentation section, working with SmartArt in presentation, gives a working sample.

We have improved the presentation rendering support in new API as compared to the legacy API. Now there's better export of charts, text, tables and other shapes to images, PDF, SVG and HTML formats using our new unified API.

We have also rectified some reported issues regarding presentation access and saving in this release. In order to get a quick start and get familiarize with new API, we have added some migration samples for your reference. Please visit documentation section Migration from Earlier Versions of Aspose.Slides for Java for your further reference. We have also maintained the entire live documentation in accordance with new unified API. You can please visit the live documentation sections for more insight about how to use the new API. There are also some known issues in this release and we are working to correct them. We are hopeful to overcome these limitations in upcoming versions gradually.
