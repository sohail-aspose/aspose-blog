## Create PDF Files in C# {#Create-PDF-Files-in-CSharp}

Let's start by creating a simple PDF document containing a text fragment. The following are the steps to create a PDF file using C#.

*   Create an object of [Document][15] class.
*   Add a page to the document using [Document.Pages.Add()][16] method.
*   Create a new [TextFragment][17] object and set its text.
*   Add _TextFragment_ to the [Paragraphs][18] collection of the page.
*   Save the PDF file using [Document.Save(String)][19] method.

The following code sample shows how to create a simple PDF file using C#.

## Edit a PDF File in C# {#Edit-Existing-PDF-in-CSharp}

Modifying a PDF file is as simple as creating a new one. Simply load the file using the [Document][21] class, perform your desired operations, and save it. The following are the steps to modify a PDF.

*   Create an object of the [Document][22] class and provide a PDF file's path to its constructor.
*   Manipulate the pages or content of the document.
*   Save the document using [Document.Save()][23] method.

The following code sample shows how to modify a PDF using C#.

## Insert Image in PDF using C# {#Insert-Image-in-PDF-using-CSharp}

Let's now check how to insert an image into the PDF document. The following are the steps to do so.

*   Create an object of [Document][24] class to open a PDF document.
*   Access the page you want to add an image to using [Page][25] class.
*   Add the image to the pageâ€™s [Resources][26] collection.
*   Use operators to place the image on the page:
    *   [GSave][27] operator to save the current graphical state.
    *   [ConcatenateMatrix][28] operator to specify where the image is to be placed.
    *   [Do][29] operator to draw the image on the page.
    *   Finally, use the [GRestore][30] operator to save the updated graphical state.
*   Save the PDF file.

The following code sample shows how to add an image to a PDF document using C#.

*   Load the PDF file using [Document][32] class.
*   Initialize a table and set its columns and rows using [Table][33] class.
*   Set table's settings (i.e. borders).
*   Populate table by creating rows using [Table.Rows.Add()][34] method.
*   Add the table to the page using _Document.Pages\[1\].Paragraphs.Add(Table)_ method.
*   Save the PDF file.

The following code sample shows how to create and add a table in a PDF document in C#.
