After long time work, in this version we have supported Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Reporting Services. Another exciting feature in this version is Report Viewer support. Microsoft Report Viewer is a powerful .NET control allowing the use of RDL and RDLC reports in WinForms and ASP.NET applications. By installing Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services on a development machine, you will be able to add the ability to export to PDF format from Report Viewer working in local mode.
