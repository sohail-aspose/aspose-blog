There has been great demand of creating Form fields using Aspose.Pdf for Java and keeping this requirement in mind, we’ve just released Aspose.Pdf for Java 2.5.0 which provides this feature. More along, a very powerful feature named Floating Box (floating paragraph) which can be placed at any location on the page, while specifying its absolute positioning information, rather than using relative positioning.  Another demanding feature by most of the customers is to convert HTML file into PDF format, but due to some technical reasons the BindHTML method is not available. So as a workaround, a new method of converting HTML pages into PDF formatting using InLineHTML has been introduced. Nevertheless, some other wonderful features i.e. the support for adding nested tables, adding Foot Notes and End Notes, support for creating multiple column documents, Creation of Table Of Contents/List Of Tables/List Of Figures, adding attachments to PDF documents, Specifying security constraints for the PDF file, the facility to add Graph object such as Arc, Curve, Rectangle etc are also provided.

In short, with the release of this version, now Aspose.Pdf for Java contains most of the features that were earlier only available in Aspose.Pdf for .NET. Some features are still missing and we hope to share them in next release.
