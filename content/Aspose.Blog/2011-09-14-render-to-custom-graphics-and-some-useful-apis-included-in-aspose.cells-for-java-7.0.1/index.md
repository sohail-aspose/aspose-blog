We have just released next ported version v7.0.1. It includes some useful enhancements for worksheet-to-image and Excel-to-PDF features. It now supports the “render to custom graphics” feature. We also made some valuable APIs available that were missing in the previous version.

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
