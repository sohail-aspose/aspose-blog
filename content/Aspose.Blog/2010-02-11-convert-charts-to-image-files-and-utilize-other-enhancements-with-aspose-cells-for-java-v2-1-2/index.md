We have released Aspose.Cells for Java v2.1.2 for the users.

In this version, we have introduced Chart-to-Image feature for our users’ demand and included several other enhancements. We have provided some valuable features. For example, the pictures in Header/Footer for Excel 2007 format would be retained when you export or copy spreadsheets. You can set the position of a picture to the center of a given range of cells. We have added support to calculate FREQUENCY formula. The component now supports to import Rich Text in SpreadsheetML file. You can also add calculated filed in pivot tables.

Moreover, we have improved the Style’s model for performance considerations. We have also boosted the LightCells API. We have optimized reading large Excel 2007 files operation. There are some bug fixes and other enhancements too.
