## Text Vectorization in C# - API Installation {#section1}

[Aspose.SVG for .NET][5] API has been designed to create, edit, and manipulate SVG images programmatically in .NET Framework-based applications. You can install the API by downloading the DLL file from the [Downloads][6] section, or with the following [NuGet][7] installation command:

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.SVG
```

## Text Vectorization in SVG Image Programmatically using C# {#section2}

SVG images are popular because of their scalability without compromising on the quality of image. You can replace all font glyphs to path, mask, etc., elements to secure the fonts. Therefore, the vectorized text can maintain the font styles in any system environment or operating system, irrespective of the font installation. You can perform text vectorization with the following steps:

1.  Load input SVG image with [SVGDocument][8] class.
2.  Set text elements vectorization.
3.  Save the SVG document with specified [SVGSaveOptions][9].

The following code shows how to achieve text vectorization in SVG image using C# language:

## Vectorize Text in SVG Image from a URL Programmatically in C# {#section3}

SVG images are vastly used over the internet and you may need to vectorize text from an online image. The API supports loading the source image directly from the URL and then vectorising the text. You need to follow the following steps to vectorize an SVG image from a URL:

1.  Load input SVG image file from a URL.
2.  Initialize [SVGSaveOptions][10] class object.
3.  Set [VectorizeText][11] property to a boolean value.
4.  Save output SVG image.

The code below explains how to vectorize text in an online SVG image programmatically using C#:

## Get Free API License

You can evaluate the API in its full capacity by requesting a [Free Temporary License][12].

## Conclusion

In conclusion, you have learned how to vectorize a local image as well as an online hosted SVG image programmatically using C#. Moreover, the appearance of the image is not disturbed during this process because you can apply masks, filters, and opacity to the SVG image. The vectorization secures the text and the font glyphs from unwanted or unauthorized use as per your requirements. You can explore other features of the API by visiting the [Documentation][13]. Please feel free to write to us at [Free Support Forum][14] for any of your queries.
