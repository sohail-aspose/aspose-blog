Yahoo is opening their e-mail system APIs to third party developers recently. Furthermore, he also anounced the unlimited storage for Yahoo!Mail previously.

What it shows is that we are getting another cheap storage on the cyber-world. Wow, it's Cool. You can save all of your emails to Yahoo without warry about the storage. Files, documents, pictures, almost anything can be uploaded without limitation.

How do you think if we create Aspose.Network.Yahoo which leverages the unlimitedÂ Yahoo!Mail storage. .NET developers just use it as a normal FileSystem without regarding the complicated network programming. It sounds like a nice component.
