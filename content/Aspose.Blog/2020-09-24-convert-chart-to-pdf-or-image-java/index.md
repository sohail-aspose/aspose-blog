Excel files are generally used to work with numeric data. Moreover, charts are rendered to represent data in pictorial form. You can convert a chart to an image or [PDF][1] in your Java applications. Aspose.Cells for Java API offer a lot of features to create, edit, or manipulate [XLSX][2], [XLS][3], [XLSM][4], [XLSB][5], and other [supported file formats][6] without needing to install Microsoft Excel. In this article, we will be exploring the support for chart rendering to image and PDF file format. Let us outline the features we will be covering here:

*   [Chart to Image and PDF Conversion API][7]
*   [Convert a Chart to Image using Java][8]
*   [Convert all Charts in Worksheets to Images using Java][9]
*   [Chart to PDF Conversion using Java][10]

Let us learn the details to better understand chart rendering support in the API.
