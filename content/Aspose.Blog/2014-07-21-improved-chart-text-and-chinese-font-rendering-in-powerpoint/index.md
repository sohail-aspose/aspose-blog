We like to share the release announcement for [Aspose.Slides for Java][1] 8.7.0. This is a maintenance release and one of the last product releases for the legacy Aspose.Slides API that will be maintained for a period of three months to make a smooth transition from legacy to the new Aspose.Slides for Java API.

## Fixes and Improvements

We have focused on resolving rendering issues in this version and have made good progress towards fixing issues with charts, tables and text rendering in generated PDF and slide thumbnails for both Windows and Mac. We have resolved rendering issues like East Asian fonts rendering, missing charts, missing background, missing images and text in this new release.

A marked improvement has also been achieved in terms of API performance as compared to its predecessor. Some issues with corrupted presentation have also been rectified in this release.
