![Aspose.Slides icon][1]

We have released Aspose.Slides for .NET 6.4.0. This release is primarily a maintenance release but we have added support for adding a secondary Y-axis to charts. We've also updated the feature that lets you get the updated thumbnail of a presentation in Windows Explorer once updated. The major focus of this release has been improving the presentation rendering support and export to PDF. Some presentation access issues have also been addressed along with some modifications in chart support.
