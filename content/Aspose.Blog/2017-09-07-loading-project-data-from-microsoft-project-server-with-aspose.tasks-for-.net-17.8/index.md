We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Tasks for .NET 17.8][1]. This month’s release provides support for working with rate scale information in the post-2013 MPP file format. It also fixes several bugs that were reported with the previous version of the API. For a detailed note on what is new and fixed, please visit the [release notes section][2] of API documentation.

# Enhancements

**Support for Rate Scale Information Reading Writing:** Aspose.Tasks for .NET already supported reading/writing rate scale information of resource assignment for MPP 2013 and below versions. With this release, the API now supports reading and writing [rate scale data][3] for MSP 2013 and above MPP file formats. This is as illustrated in the following code sample:



**Loading Project Data from MSP Database:**  Working with loading project data from Microsoft Project Data was supported in one of the earlier versions of API. This, however, had issues with the update of Microsoft Project Database versions update and the functionality was broken. We are glad to share that this issue has been fixed now. You can now [load Project data][4] from the Project database using this latest version of the API.
