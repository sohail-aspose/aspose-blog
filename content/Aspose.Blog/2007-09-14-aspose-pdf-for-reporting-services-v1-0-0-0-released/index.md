**Introduction**

Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services fulfills a need that many organizations are faced withâ€”the need to build business intelligence and reporting solutions. Until now, developers were required to embed reports into their applications, or organizations were required to purchase expensive and sometimes problematic third-party reporting solutions. Now, Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services offer a complete solution for distributing reports across the enterprise; enabling businesses to make decisions better and faster.

Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services is another unique solution from Aspose, that makes possible generating PDF reports in Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005 Reporting Services. All RDL report features, including tables, matrices, charts and images are converted with the highest degree of precision to PDF.
