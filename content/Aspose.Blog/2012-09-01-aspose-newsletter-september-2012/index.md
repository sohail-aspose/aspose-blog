## Meet Our Ventures

Aspose has developed a number of different tools that help us work and communicate more effectively within the company. We have decided to share some of these tools. Our new ventures, Saaspose and GroupDocs give developers and individuals access to the products that we use the most. Developers working in the cloud benefit from [Saaspose][1], cloud-based file management APIs based on Aspose's most popular products. [GroupDocs][2] is a suite of online document management tools and APIs aimed at professionals who need to sign, convert, assemble and collaborate on documents.

Thank you for reading,  
John Owens, Aspose Scotland Team Leader

### Product Spotlight – Aspose.Cells

[](http://bit.ly/pGWTWN)[Aspose.Cells for .NET][4] and [Aspose.Cells for Java][5] gives you control of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets so that you can work with them easily in your applications. Open, read, save and create spreadsheets, add or remove data, control formatting, work with charts and drawings, control formulas, add pivot tables and much more. The easy-to-use APIs saves time and effort by giving you access to our file format expertise. We also have Aspose.Cells available for [SharePoint][6], [SQL Server Reporting Services][7] and [JasperReports][8] so that you can output files to native Microsoft Excel formats.

### Technical Article – Recognize Barcodes in PDFs with Aspose.Pdf and Aspose.BarCode

Aspose.Pdf for .NET works with our other .NET components to provide powerful document management features. Several of our customers embed barcodes into PDF files and then need to be able to read those barcodes. We have a technical article that explains how to use Aspose.Pdf with Aspose.BarCode to perform this task. Read the article.

### Tutorial Video – How to Create a Mail Merge Template for use in Aspose.Words for .NET

[](http://bit.ly/Ritplf)Aspose.Words for .NET helps developers automate a lot of document activities, for example mail merges. Before performing a mail merge, you need to add fields to a template which is then populated from a data source. The mail merge process helps you create large runs of letters, contracts, reports and so on. We have a tutorial video that shows you how to prepare a mail merge template. [Watch the video][9].

### Migration Tip – Adding Tasks to Projects with Aspose.Tasks for .NET vs VSTO

Aspose.Tasks for .NET lets developers work with Microsoft Project files directly, independently of Microsoft Office Automation. Aspose.Tasks gives you the power to create, open and manipulate project files. A crucial activity when working with projects is adding tasks. Aspose.Tasks and VSTO both lets you do this and we have an article that shows how the two approaches differ. Read the migration tip.
