Dear Customers,

Aspose sales is now using a ticket system which helps us handle our emails more efficiently. The ticket system will allow multiple people to manage our sales emails without the fear of losing them or accidentally not seeing them. If you ever send us an email and are not answered within a day or so, please send us another email. Chances are that it didn’t make it through. We generally are very fast in response time. We look forward to answering each of your questions in a more timely fashion.

If you have any questions or would like an email quote, please just send your requests to [sales@aspose.com][1]. I am more than happy to help you. Also, if you would like to know more about getting in contact with me, check my Blog. I have just recently updated my About and Contact pages to help serve you better.

Thanks,

Merit Cooper

Sales
