We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Email for .NET 6.7.0][1]. This month's release contains minor enhancements related to setting security options and retaining content-disposition information while loading and saving email files. It also fixes a number of bugs reported by our valued customers that further aids to the stability of the API functionality. For a detailed note on what is new and fixed, please visit the [Product Release Notes][2] page of this month's release.

## Enhancements

**Provision of Auto Determination of SSL Mode:** The SecurityOptions mode offered by the API included None, Auto, SSLImplicit and SSLExplicit options. This month’s release adds another option of SSLAuto to this Enumerator that avoids setting the security options to None while selecting between the two SSL options at the same time.

**Retaining Content-Disposition during Message Load and Save:** With this month’s release, the API now retains the content-disposition boundaries while loading and saving email messages. This helps restore the message meta-information using any MD5 check or any other measured parameter which is formulated based on message contents.

## Other Improvements

A number of bugs have been fixed in this month’s release which further stabilizes the API functionality in terms of usability.
