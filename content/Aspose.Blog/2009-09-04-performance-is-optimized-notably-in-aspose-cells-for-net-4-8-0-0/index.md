We are pleased to release Aspose.Cells for .NET 4.8.0.0 for the users.

In the new version, we have optimized / enhanced the performance for Formula recalculations with support of some new MS Excel built-in functions, inserting/deleting Rows/Columns and Auto-fitting Rows/Columns feature. Now, you can add WordArt shapes to your spreadsheets and read Gradient fill effects in the chart. Moreover, for Worksheet-to-Image feature, the support for multiple Print Areas is available now. We have also provided support for setting Image Options in Chart-to-Image and Worksheet-to-Image features. This release includes over 100 fixes and other enhancements too.

Just for your knowledge, we have now merged Aspose.Grid suite with Aspose.Cells for .NET _MSI_ installer. You can install it and add reference only to Aspose.Cells.dll library (from your installed folder) in your project for your need. You may also take advantage using Aspose.Cells Grid controls though if you want to manipulate excel files in the grid in WYSIWYG manner.
