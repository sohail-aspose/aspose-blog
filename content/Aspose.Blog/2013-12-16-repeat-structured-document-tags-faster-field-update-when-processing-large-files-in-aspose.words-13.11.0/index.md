Aspose.Words 13.11.0 has been released with this month’s release containing 80 useful improvements to the Aspose.Words products.

You can download the latest release of Aspose.Words from the following links:

*   [Aspose.Words for .NET 13.11.0][1]
*   [Aspose.Words for Java 13.11.0][2]
*   [Aspose.Words for Android 1.4][3]

Here is a look at just a few of the biggest features in this month’s release. For a full list of bug fixes and improvements please refer to the download pages in the links above.

## Repeate Structured Document Tags

Structured document tags (also known as content controls) are dynamic document elements that can be added to display and insert information in different ways and can be interacted with by the user. One special type of structured document tag, in particular, allows the user to repeat data from via data binding to an XML file (much like Aspose.Word’s mail merge engine with fields).

Aspose.Words now supports this type of content control when exporting to [different supported formats][4] so the output document retains the repeating data as it appears in the input document.

## Field Update Performance Gets Even Faster

Using the latest release of Aspose.Words you should see a noticeable improvement in the field update when working with large documents. The Aspose.Words developers have redesigned some parts of the field engine and have not only made it more secure and more resilient to bugs in the future but at the same time by doing this also increased field update performance by up to 33%. This is a great step forward for a field engine that is already [highly optimized and full of features][5].

As always we appreciate your feedback so if you ever have anything to tell us about this release or anything else, please head to the [Aspose.Words forum][6] for a chat.
