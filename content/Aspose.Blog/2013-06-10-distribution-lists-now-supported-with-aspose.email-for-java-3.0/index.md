[](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/02/aspose.email-logo120.jpg)[![Aspose.Email for Java logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/06/aspose-Email-for-Java_100.png)Aspose.Email for Java 3.0 has been released with a number of bug fixes and a new feature.

Microsoft Outlook offers capability to create contact distribution lists in a PST. This feature was lagging in our API until this monthâ€™s release. We are pleased to share that creating and reading distribution lists in PST is now supported by Aspose.Email. Users can access contact distribution lists from the contacts folder with a check on the message class which should be IPM.DistList.

This month's release also includes a number of bug fixes related to message conversion to various formats, retrieving and converting messages from a PST file, and encoding issues with different email messages.

To get further details about what's new & fixed, read the release notes on the [Aspose.Email for Java][2] release page.
