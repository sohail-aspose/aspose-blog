We like to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for .NET 7.4.0.

This is primarily a maintenance release with focus on improved chart rendering. A new feature support for setting predefined or customized data format for chart data has been included in this new release. Please visit this documentation link for your further reference.

Some issues related to charting support including editing of Aspose.Slides generated charts in PowerPoint and effects on charts when changing chart data using external Microsoft Excel files have been resolved in this release. The chart alignment issues including plot area and legends rendering in thumbnails have also been resolved. We have also enhanced the performance of Aspose.Slides when exporting large presentations to PDF.
