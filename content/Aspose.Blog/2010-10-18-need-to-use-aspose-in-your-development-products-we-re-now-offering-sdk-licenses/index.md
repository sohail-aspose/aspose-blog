Over the years our products have evolved into the most powerful, independent libraries available for managing files. No other solutions offer the type of comprehensive file support and features that Aspose libraries deliver. Now, other companies can provide that same powerful functionality to their audience through our tools.  
  
If you produce a product that can be enhanced by the functionality we provide, please be sure to visit our newly updated [SDK Policy Page][1]. Similarly if you're using another library that could be greatly improved by our products please do not hesitate to recommend this program to your provider.
