[![Aspose.Email for Java][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/02/aspose.email-logo120.jpg)Aspose.Email for .NET 2.5.0 has been released. This month's release not only includes important bug fixes, but also some enhancements demanded by our customers.

This version includes an enhancement of  [saving messages from PST to Memory stream][2] directly by enumerating MessageInfo or message entry IDs. This was not supported with the earlier versions, as message extraction from PST files followed extraction of MessageInfo first and then retrieved the complete message based on information from the MessageInfo objects.

Adding folder permissions to Exchange folders was supported by earlier versions of Aspose.Email. With this release, now retrieving folder permissions on an Exchange Server is supported as well.

This release also includes some important bug fixes. PST-to-PST and PST-to-OST message copying operations have been improved. Various issues related to EML-to-MHTML and MSG-to-EML conversions have also been resolved.

To get further details about what's new and fixed, read the release notes on the [Aspose.Email for .NET][3] release page.
