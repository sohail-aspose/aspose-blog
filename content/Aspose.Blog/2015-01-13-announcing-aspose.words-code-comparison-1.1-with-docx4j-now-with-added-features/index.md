[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/06/aspose_words-for-java.png)[![][2]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/08/docx4j.png)We've created a new release of the Aspose.Words for Java comparison to Docx4j. The new release, [Aspose.Words vs Docx4j 1.1][3], shows a number of Aspose.Words examples and code comparison with Docx4j.

This release contains a few new code comparison examples of features that are available in both Aspose APIs and in Docx4j.
