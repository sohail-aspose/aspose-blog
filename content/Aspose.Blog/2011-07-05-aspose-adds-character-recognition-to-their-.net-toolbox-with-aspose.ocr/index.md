**Australia, Sydney – 5 July, 2011 –** Aspose.OCR for .NET is a character recognition component that allows software developers to add OCR functionality to their ASP .NET web applications, web services and Windows applications. It provides a simple set of classes for controlling character recognition tasks.

# Efficient character recognition

Extracting text from Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF files is relatively simple. In those file formats the text is separate, stored as content with formatting markup. Turning images into text is a much more difficult task. There is no logic in the file to show that something is a character, a word or a sentence. Aspose.OCR provides the logic that allows a program to recognize the shapes of text in images.

Aspose.OCR recognizes when an image file, BMP or TIFF in the initial release, contains text and can convert the bitmap images to editable text. It does so quickly and effectively, saving time and processing resources. As well as recognizing characters, Aspose.OCR recognizes text formatting and can tell bold and italicized text from plain text. It supports Arial and Times New Roman fonts in various sizes.

# Building the toolbox

Aspose is known for creating effective and user-friendly components and class libraries that save software developers a lot of time when coding applications. In May, 2011, the company released Aspose.Diagram, a class library for working with Microsoft Visio files within ASP .NET, web services and Windows applications. Aspose.OCR joins a growing family of popular .NET components that give software developers the tools they need to work with a long list of word processing, spreadsheet and presentation file formats.
