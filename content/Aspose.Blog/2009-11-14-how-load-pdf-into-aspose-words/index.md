You already know that Aspose.Words can convert DOC, DOCX, ODT, etc to PDF very well, but you might be wondering can it convert it the other way around?

The answer is **yes**. But you need to use our specialized and "experimental" product Aspose.Recognition for .NET. It can convert PDF to any document format supported by Aspose.Words, that are DOC, DOCX, ODT, MHTML, and others.

If you are interested, Aspose.Recognition internally consists of a PDF parsing module, an artificial intelligence engine that "figures out what is a paragraph and what is a table" and an embedded version of Aspose.Words to save the resulting document in any of the word processing document formats.
