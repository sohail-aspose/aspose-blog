Please welcome Aspose.Words for Reporting Services 3.0.1.0, the first release of the product in the new year. This is just a hotfix release that addresses a few issues reported by the customers; however, we always recommend updating to the latest version of the product, because the newer, the better.

We have also added the **Code Samples** section to the product's documentation. Commonly, a rendering extension is not something programmable - it should be installed and forgotten, functioning on the background when the user selects a corresponding export format. However, there are situations in which you require some coding. The most obvious use case is when you need to render RDL reports programmatically - this was asked by our users from time to time. Voila, the first couple of code samples included into the documentation exactly demonstrate how to export reports to Microsoft Word documents in code via Reporting Services Web service as well as via Report Viewer working in local mode. Enjoy.
