Brian's post that mentions Aspose.Words is [Friday Thoughts][1]. Thanks Brian, we are happy to attract this kind of attention. Looking forward for more positive comments.

To clarify things with Aspose.Words and WordprocessingML:

*   At the moment Aspose.Words supports export to WordprocessingML that was available in Microsoft Word 2003.
*   WordprocessingML import in Aspose.Words is coming out early 2007.
*   Support for OpenXML in Aspose.Words is coming out Q1 2007.
*   Aspose.Words strives to provide most accurate conversions and most comprehensive support for Microsoft Word file formats.

My personal comments:

*   It is confusing that WordprocessingML from Microsoft Word 2003 and WordprocessingML in OpenXML are called the same: WordprocessingML yet they are different things.
*   WordprocessingML is a looong word, it would have been better if the official name was WordML.
