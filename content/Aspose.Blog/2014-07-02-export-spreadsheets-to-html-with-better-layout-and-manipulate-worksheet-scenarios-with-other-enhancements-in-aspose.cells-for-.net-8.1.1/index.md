[![Aspose.Cells for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Cells-for-net_100.png)Aspose.Cells for .NET 8.1.1 has been released. This new release contains some useful features and other improvements.  It also includes over 20 fixes and other enhancements. Before you go ahead and start exploring the new features and other enhancements, we will list here some major features and other enhancements in this month’s release.

## Added HtmlSaveOptions.PresentationPreference Property

The HtmlSaveOptions class has now exposed the PresentationPreference attribute which can be used to render the results with better layout when exporting spreadsheets to HTML or MHT file format. The default value is false, whereas if set to true, the Aspose.Cells API will export the worksheet contents with better presentation. Please check the detailed article Use PresentationPreference Option for Better Layout.

## Support for Worksheet Scenarios

The Aspose.Cells API provides the Worksheet.Scenarios property along with the following classes in order to facilitate creating, manipulating and removing scenarios from worksheets:

1.  Scenario
2.  ScenarioCollection
3.  ScenarioInputCellCollection
4.  ScenarioInputCell

Please check the detailed article How to Create, Manipulate or Remove Scenarios from Worksheets.

## Other Enhancements and Fixes

In the new version, we have fixed a few exceptions that occurred while reading Microsoft Excel files, manipulating styles and calculating formulas. We also fixed the OutOfMemoryException that occurred when detecting file formats.

In this release, several important issues have been addressed. For example, issues around reading and writing Microsoft Excel files, manipulating style and formatting, rendering and manipulating pivot tables, manipulating shapes, rendering images from Excel worksheets, manipulating charts, rendering images files from charts, using Microsoft Add-ins and exporting Excel workbooks to PDF format have been resolved.

We also enhanced the Grid controls provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET for reading and manipulating Excel files.
