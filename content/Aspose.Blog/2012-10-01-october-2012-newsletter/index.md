Welcome to the October 2012 edition of Saaspose Newsletter. This newsletter highlights the information about latest updates in APIs, exciting new features and the informative blogs. Keep your fingers crossed for the useful tip revealed in "Tip of the Month" section.![](https://blog.aspose.com/)

![](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/06/tip.png)**Tip of the Month: Integrate DropBox Storage with Saaspose API** If you have stored your documents at DropBox and you want to process those documents with [Saaspose APIs][1] then we have a good news for you! Previously, we introduced support for [Amazon S3 storage integration with Saaspose APIs][2] under our endeavor to integrate our APIs with external storage providers and it was welcomed quite warmly by our customers. Now, we have implemented support for [DropBox storage integration with Saaspose APIs][3] as well; this blog post gives you an idea about how to setup DropBox with Saaspose API via our Web UI. We have also started working on examples to process your files with Saaspose from DropBox. You can keep updated with new examples through our newsletter, [blog][4], and documentation. ![](https://blog.aspose.com/)
