[![Aspose.Cells logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/05/aspose.cells-logo2.jpg)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Cells for .NET 7.2.1. This monthâ€™s release allows you to input strings larger than 32K for text and CSV formats. We have enhanced the shapes rendering module, specifically improving Excel-to-PDF conversion. We have also improved the Smart Markers feature so that Aspose.Cells for .NET now supports nested objects in Smart Markers.

Moreover, we have made some enhancements regarding PivotTables and the internal Worksheet-to-Image modules and fixed some other issues. We have also enhanced the Formula Calculation Engine and fixed a few of its issues.
