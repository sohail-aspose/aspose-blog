[![Aspose.Diagram for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/06/aspose-Diagram-for-net_100.png)We are pleased to announce that the [new version 17.3.0 of Aspose.Diagram for .NET API][2] is now live. The new version of the API adds three new enhancements along with the regular bug fixes. It has improved the hyperlinking mechanism of Visio shapes as well as aligning shapes accurately with respect to the absolute values of PinX and PinY cells. Developers can also find an improvement in preserving the cylindrical type of shapes. Developers can install an Aspose.Diagram Nuget package in their .NET applications because we publish each version as [a NuGet package on the NuGet gallery][3]. We recommend our clients upgrade old version of Aspose.Diagram API to this latest one. For details on API fixes, please check Release Notes having a complete list of the features, enhancements and bug fixes.

## An Enhancement to Hyperlink Shapes in VSDMAspose.Diagram for .NET API has already added support of linking a shape or group of the shapes in the Visio drawing. However, in the particular use case, a client was not able to add a hyperlink to a shape in VSDM drawing. As the API consumers, developers can find an overall improvement in that area. This article narrates how to add a hyperlink in the drawing, and then save in any supported format: [Working with Hyperlinks][4]  

## Aligning Shapes Accurately using PinX and PinY ValuesAspose.Diagram for .NET API can place shapes anywhere in the Visio drawing. Developers are using an AddShape method of the Diagram class, which takes PinX, PinY and page index parameters. PinX and PinY represent XY-coordinates of the shape's pin (center of rotation). In the scenario of placing three shapes using the same PinX and PinY values, the API was placing shapes on different locations. The recent version 17.3.0 of Aspose.Diagram API has enhanced this scenario in the generic way. This help topic shows how developers can place and connect multiple shapes in the Visio drawing: [Add and Connect Visio Shapes][5]   
  
The recent version also comprises a series of bug fixes which leads to the primary means of quality assurance so that we encouraged the input of our clients. In general, it improves export of the VSD to PDF, accuracy in the calculation while grouping multiple shapes, layout structure of connectors and edit the text of shape after saving into the VDX format.
