Dear Customers,

Thanks for considering Aspose.

We are glad to announce that Aspose.Grid Wiki has just got better than before. We have made many enhancements to Aspose.Grid Wiki that are listed below:

*   Topics are arranged in a precise manner to make them look more organized.
*   **Programmer's Guide** is completely re-created.
*   Each topic is illustrated with code snippets (in C# & VB.NET) & related screenshots.
*   **Technical Articles** section is created that provides more useful information to customers on **HowTo's** topics with the help of sample applications and detailed explanations. The new **Data Binding** articles will also be pretty useful for the customers.
*   Programmer's Guide is divided into two parts. One for **Aspose.Grid.Desktop** and other for **Aspose.Grid.Web.** It would help customers to find targeted information more easily.

For reporting any problems or giving your valuable suggestions about Aspose.Grid.Wiki, please email at [sialkot@aspose.com][1]
