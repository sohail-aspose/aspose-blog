Welcome to Aspose's August Newsletter

August already! Where is 2011 going!? Well, as ever it's been a busy time here at Aspose. Earlier this month we released [Aspose.OCR for .NET][1] which allows you to add OCR capabilities to your applications with the ease you'd expect from Aspose components. As with all new components you can download Aspose.OCR for .NET today at no additional cost if you have a valid Aspose.Total for .NET subscription.

Upgrade to Aspose.PDF for .NET V6.0 – Aspose.PDF.Kit for .NET and Aspose.PDF for .NET have now been merged. Customers can now create and edit PDF files from within one product. Upgrade to version 6.0 of Aspose.PDF for .NET to ensure you migrate your code to the latest version of Aspose.PDF for .NET before support is retired in October 2011. [Find out more][2].

As you may know, our SharePoint range of products has recently been extended with the introduction of Aspose.Network for SharePoint. Along with this growth our SharePoint range is getting some [rave reviews][3]. Frustrated by SharePoint's built in document handling capabilities? Download a free no obligation trial today to boost SharePoint's capabilities and allow users to get their documents in the formats they need them in.

Many thanks,  
John Owens, Aspose Scotland Team Leader

Changes to Support

We are making some changes to which support options we offer our users. To ensure that customers are getting the most appropriate level of support, we now offer Priority Support to customers who have Developer licenses (Developer Small Business or Developer OEM). Enterprise Support is offered to customers with Site licenses (Site Small Business, Site OEM). We are also changing the pricing of support to better reflect the benefits the different options offer. [Read more about our support options][5].

Product Spotlight – Aspose.OCR for .NET

Aspose.OCR for .NET was released on 5 July, 2011. Aspose.OCR recognizes when an image file, BMP or TIFF in the initial release, contains text and can convert the bitmap images to editable text. It does so quickly and effectively, saving time and processing resources. As well as recognizing characters, Aspose.OCR recognizes text formatting and can tell bold and italicized text from plain text. It supports Arial and Times New Roman fonts in various sizes. Download and evaluate Aspose.OCR for .NET.

Tutorial Video – Extracting text from a block in an image with Aspose.OCR

[](https://docs.aspose.com/display/emailnet/Home)This video tutorial shows how to use Aspose.OCR for .NET to scan a specific block of an image. Step by step it walks you through how to load an image, specify the language and configuration settings, specify the recognition block, set a resource path and start the OCR process.

Migration Tip - Saving VSD files as other formats from Aspose.Diagram

[](https://docs.aspose.com/display/emailnet/Home)Aspose.Diagram for .NET lets developers work with Microsoft Visio diagrams without using Microsoft Automation. It is possible to open a Microsoft Visio diagram and export it to other file formats using VSTO as well as Aspose.Diagram. Achieving this task using Aspose.Diagram for .NET takes fewer lines of code, as this migration tip shows. [Read the migration tip][8].
