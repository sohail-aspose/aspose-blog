Blazor framework is widely used to build interactive and reusable web UI in web technologies. Moreover, Blazor WebAssembly apps execute directly in the browser on a WebAssembly-based .NET runtime. This article covers how to use [System.Drawing][1] library in a [Blazor WebAssembly][2] app. The API can be used to draw text strings, images, vector graphics, etc. Let us go through this article under the following headings to learn more details:
