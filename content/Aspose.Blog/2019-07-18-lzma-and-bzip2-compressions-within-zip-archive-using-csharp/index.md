Guys, let's check out what’s new for you in [Aspose.ZIP for .NET 19.6][1] release.

## LZMA Compression within ZIP Archive using C#

The **Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm** (**LZMA**) is an algorithm used to perform lossless data compression. [LZMA][2] uses a dictionary compression algorithm, the compressed stream is a stream of bits. LZMA compression within [ZIP][3] archive allows ZIP container to contain LZMA compressed entries. The following code examples show the implementation of LZMA compression using Aspose.ZIP for .NET API.

## BZip2 Compression within ZIP Archive using C#

**[BZip2][4]** compression settings allow ZIP container to contain BZip2 compressed entries. The following code examples show the implementation of BZip2 compression using Aspose.ZIP API.
