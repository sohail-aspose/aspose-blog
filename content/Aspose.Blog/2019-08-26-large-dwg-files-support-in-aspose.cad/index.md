Hi guys! I am back with all new blog to give you a walk through of latest [Aspose.CAD for .NET/Java][1] 19.7. As a standard practice, Aspose team publishes both .NET and Java based API having same features sets simultaneously. I will be giving you overview of what new features have been included in API along with example code to use them.

## Loading Large DWG Files in C#

Aspose.CAD for .NET provides facility to open very large DWG files using **CadImage** class. Now you can easily open large files with the help of sample example given below.
