We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.1.0. We have included support for some of much awaited new features in this releases along with resolution of outstanding issues.

## New Features

Earlier, if you needed to alter the text formatting for table rows or columns, you needed to traverse through every row or column respectively for setting the text formatting. Now, Aspose.Slides offers a new feature for setting the text format on [table level][1] , [row level][2], [columns level][3].

You can also set the slide size by using it with different ways of content scaling. Please visit the documentation article, [Setting the Slide Size with respect to Content Scaling][4] for your further reference. Now, you can also use the custom chart data label values from chart data workbook as well. Please visit the documentation article, [Setting the Workbook Cell As Chart Data Label][5]

## Resolved Issues

We have resolved the issues related to presentation saving which earlier resulted in missing or wrong fonts, missing headers, improper text, missing hyperlinks and wrong line styles for shapes in saved presentations. We have also addressed the presentation access and saving issues have been rectified for many presentation decks that resulted in exceptions including NullReferenceException, ArgumentException, NotImplementedException and PptxReadException in previous releases.

We have improved the presentation rendering support in this release and have resolved certain issues related to missing or improper text rendering, missing images, missing charts and its entities in generated PDF, HTML and slide thumbnails outputs.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.1.0 Release Notes][6] for further reference.
