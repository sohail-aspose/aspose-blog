Dear Customers,

We've released Aspose.Network 3.2.0.0.

What's new in this release:

*   Adding **Aspose.Network.Logging**, which is an extensible and comprehansive .net logging framework.
*   Fixed the bug in ImapClient.ListMessages, which may lead to throw out invalid parameter exception when initializing MailAddress instances.
*   All other updates from 3.1.\*

Thanks
