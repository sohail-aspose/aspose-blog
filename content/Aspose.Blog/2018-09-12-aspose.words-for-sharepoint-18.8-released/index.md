We are really delighted to announce the release of version 18.8 of the [Aspose.Words for SharePoint][1] API. This release comes with some very exciting features to enhance the usability of the API. We are pleased to announce that Aspose.Words for SharePoint extensions are supported only in "Classic experience" mode of **SharePoint 2019 Public Preview**. "Modern experience" support is still under development. This version also sees the codebase better tweaked and the core functionality closer to Aspose.Words for .NET 18.8, which is the base product that **Aspose.Words for SharePoint 18.8** is ported from.  
We recommend you to download the latest release and check out all the features introduced in the base Aspose.Words for .NET API. You can download the latest release of Aspose.Words for SharePoint from the following link:
