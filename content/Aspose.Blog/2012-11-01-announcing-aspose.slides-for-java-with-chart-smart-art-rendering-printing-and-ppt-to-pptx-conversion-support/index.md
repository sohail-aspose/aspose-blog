We proudly present the long awaited version of Aspose.Slides for Java 3.0.0, developed by autoporting all the features from Aspose.Slides for .NET.

Now, Aspose.Slides for .NET and Aspose.Slides for Java are comparable in terms of features. Many new features have been included in the release of Aspose.Slides for Java:  features like printing presentations, chart rendering, SmartArt rendering and PPT/ODP to PPTX conversion, for example. To find out what features the Aspose.Slides for Java API now offers, read the Features Overview.

There are differences between older Aspose.Slides for Java APIs and this new version. You can migrate code written using older Java API to this new API by observing the differences mentioned in How to Migrate to Aspose.Slides for Java 3.0.0. One of most important feature in this new API is that it is no longer dependent on JAI or other libraries for rendering presentations.

When I tested the new API I noticed that it is uniform with Aspose.Slides for .NET so that it's easy to port the code from .NET to Java to create Aspose.Slides for Java.  This means that our developers can easily keep the two products in sync and our .NET and Java customers benefit from the same great features. That's what autoporting is all about.
