We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 4.1.0. This release adds support for ReportViewer 2010. This version has also inherited support for rendering nested tables in exported presentations. Our users have reported an issue with text getting overlapped from cells and this, as well as an issue with unwanted lines appearing for table borders in exported presentations, has been fixed.

To see a complete list of fixes and to download Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 4.1.0, [please go to the download page][2].
