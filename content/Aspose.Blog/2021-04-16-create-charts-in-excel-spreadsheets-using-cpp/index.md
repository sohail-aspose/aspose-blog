Charts are an excellent tool for concisely showing data. Moreover, they represent the data visually, making it easier to consume large amounts of data. You might find charts to be helpful in situations where you need to show data such as the monthly budget comparison or product adoption rate. In light of that, this article will teach you **how to create charts in Excel files using C++**.

## C++ API for Creating Excel Charts {#CPP-API-for-Creating-Excel-Charts}

[Aspose.Cells for C++][7] is a native C++ library that allows you to create, read and modify Excel files without requiring Microsoft Excel to be installed. The API also supports creating charts in Excel files. You can either install the API through [NuGet][8] or download it directly from the [Downloads][9] section.

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.Cells.Cpp
```

## Create Line Chart in Excel using C++ {#Create-Line-Chart-in-Excel-using-CPP}

To create a line chart, use the [ChartType\_Line][10] enum value while adding the chart. The following are the steps to create a line chart in an Excel file.

*   Firstly, create an instance of the [IWorkbook][11] class.
*   Retrieve the worksheet where you want to add the chart using the [IWorkbook->GetIWorksheets()->GetObjectByIndex (Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 index)][12] method.
*   Insert the data for the chart.
*   Add the chart to the worksheet using the [IWorksheet->GetICharts()->Add (Aspose::Cells::Charts::ChartType type,Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 upperLeftRow, Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 upperLeftColumn, Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 lowerRightRow, Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 lowerRightColumn)][13] method.
*   Access the chart with its index using the [IWorksheet->GetICharts()->GetObjectByIndex (Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 index)][14] method.
*   Add the data source for the chart using the [IChart->GetNISeries()->Add (intrusive\_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Systems::String> area, bool isVertical)][15] method.
*   Finally, save the Excel file using the [IWorkbook->Save (intrusive\_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Systems::String> fileName)][16] method.

The following is the sample code to create a line chart in Excel using C++.

## Creating Pyramid Chart in Excel using C++ {#Creating-Pyramid-Chart-in-Excel-using-CPP}

For creating a pyramid chart, use the [ChartType\_Pyramid][17] enum value to specify the chart type while adding the chart. The following are the steps to create a pyramid chart in an Excel file.

*   Firstly, create an instance of the [IWorkbook][18] class.
*   Retrieve the worksheet where you want to add the chart using the [IWorkbook->GetIWorksheets()->GetObjectByIndex (Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 index)][19] method.
*   Insert the data for the chart.
*   Add the chart to the worksheet using the [IWorksheet->GetICharts()->Add (Aspose::Cells::Charts::ChartType type,Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 upperLeftRow, Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 upperLeftColumn, Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 lowerRightRow, Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 lowerRightColumn)][20] method.
*   Access the chart with its index using the [IWorksheet->GetICharts()->GetObjectByIndex (Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 index)][21] method.
*   Add the data source for the chart using the [IChart->GetNISeries()->Add (intrusive\_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Systems::String> area, bool isVertical)][22] method.
*   Finally, save the Excel file using the [IWorkbook->Save (intrusive\_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Systems::String> fileName)][23] method.

The following is the sample code to create a pyramid chart in Excel using C++.

## Create Bubble Chart in Excel using C++ {#Create-Bubble-Chart-in-Excel-using-CPP}

In order to create a bubble chart, pass the [ChartType\_Bubble][24] enum value to the [IWorksheet->GetICharts()->Add()][25] method. The following are the steps to create a bubble chart in an Excel file.

*   Firstly, create an instance of the [IWorkbook][26] class.
*   Retrieve the worksheet where you want to add the chart using the [IWorkbook->GetIWorksheets()->GetObjectByIndex (Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 index)][27] method.
*   Insert the data for the chart.
*   Add the chart to the worksheet using the [IWorksheet->GetICharts()->Add (Aspose::Cells::Charts::ChartType type,Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 upperLeftRow, Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 upperLeftColumn, Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 lowerRightRow, Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 lowerRightColumn)][28] method.
*   Access the chart with its index using the [IWorksheet->GetICharts()->GetObjectByIndex (Aspose::Cells::Systems::Int32 index)][29] method.
*   Add the data source, bubble sizes, X values and Y values for the chart using the [IChart->GetNISeries()->Add (intrusive\_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Systems::String> area, bool isVertical)][30], [IChart->GetNISeries()->GetObjectByIndex(0)->SetBubbleSizes (intrusive\_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Systems::String> value)][31], [IChart->GetNISeries()->GetObjectByIndex(0)->SetXValues (intrusive\_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Systems::String> value)][32], [IChart->GetNISeries()->GetObjectByIndex(0)->SetValues (intrusive\_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Systems::String> value)][33] methods respectively.
*   Finally, save the Excel file using the [IWorkbook->Save (intrusive\_ptr<Aspose::Cells::Systems::String> fileName)][34] method.

The following is the sample code to create a bubble chart in Excel using C++.
