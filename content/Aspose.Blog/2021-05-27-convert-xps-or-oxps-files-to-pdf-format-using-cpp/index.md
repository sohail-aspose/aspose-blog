## C++ API for Converting XPS and OXPS Documents to PDF Format {#CPP-API-for-Converting-XPS-and-OXPS-Documents-to-PDF-Format}

[Aspose.Page for C++][8] is a C++ library for rendering and manipulating XPS and PostScript files. It allows you to create, read and update XPS documents. Furthermore, the API supports converting XPS and OXPS documents to PDF format. You can either install the API through [NuGet][9] or download it directly from the [downloads][10] section.

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.Page.Cpp
```

## Convert XPS/OXPS Documents to PDF Format {#Convert-XPS-OXPS-Documents-to-PDF-Format}

The following are the steps to convert XPS and OXPS documents to PDF format.

*   Initialize a stream with the output PDF file.
*   Initialize a stream with the source XPS/OXPS file.
*   Create an instance of the [XpsDocument][11] class using the XPS/OXPS stream.
*   Create an instance of the [PdfSaveOptions][12] class.
*   Specify options like [JpegQualityLevel][13] and [ImageCompression][14].
*   Save the output PDF file using the [XpsDocument->Save(System::SharedPtr<Device> device, System::SharedPtr<SaveOptions> options)][15] method.

The following sample code shows how to convert XPS/OXPS documents to PDF format using C++.

## Convert Selected Pages of XPS/OXPS Documents to PDF Format {#Convert-Selected-Pages-of-XPS-OXPS-Documents-to-PDF-Format}

While converting XPS and OXPS files to PDF format, you can also specify the pages you want to convert. The output PDF file will contain only the pages you select. To achieve this, please follow the steps given below.

*   Initialize a stream with the output PDF file.
*   Initialize a stream with the source XPS/OXPS file.
*   Create an instance of the [XpsDocument][16] class using the XPS/OXPS stream.
*   Create an instance of the [PdfSaveOptions][17] class.
*   Specify options like [JpegQualityLevel][18] and [ImageCompression][19].
*   Specify the pages that you want to convert using the [PdfSaveOptions->set\_PageNumbers(System::ArrayPtr<int32\_t> value)][20] method.
*   Save the output PDF file using the [XpsDocument->Save(System::SharedPtr<Device> device, System::SharedPtr<SaveOptions> options)][21] method.

The following sample code demonstrates how to convert selected pages of XPS and OXPS documents to PDF format using C++.
