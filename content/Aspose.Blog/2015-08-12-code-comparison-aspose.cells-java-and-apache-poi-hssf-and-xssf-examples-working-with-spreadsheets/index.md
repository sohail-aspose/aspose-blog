Project [Aspose.Cells Java for Apache POI HSSF and XSSF][1] shows how different tasks can be performed using Aspose.Cells Java API in comparison with Apache POI SS. Aspose.Cells Java for Apache POI SS also covers the features that are only available in Aspose.Cells Java API but not in Apache POI.

This new release, [Aspose.Cells Java vs Apache POI SS v1.4][2], shows a number of new code comparison examples of features that are available in both Aspose.Cells Java API and in Apache POI HSSF + XSSF while dealing Microsoft Office Excel and Apache OpenOffice Calc Spreadsheet documents.

**Open Source:** The source code of these examples is freely hosted on [GitHub][3] and running examples are also available to download on [CodePlex][4].
