Dear Customers,  
  
We released new 1.5.0.0 version of Aspose.Flash.  
This release is not fully compatible with previous versions.  
In this release:  

*   Rearranged namespaces and little changed old API.
*   Added support for ActionScript 2.0.

Aspose.Flash.msi contains several small demos which explain how to use and compile ActionScript.  
Detailed Programmer's Guide will be also released and published soon.
