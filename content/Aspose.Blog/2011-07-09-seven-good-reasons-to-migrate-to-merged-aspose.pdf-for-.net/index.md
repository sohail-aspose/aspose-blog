![Aspose.Pdf icon][1]

You're probably aware of the fact by now that merged Aspose.Pdf for .NET has been released. Our development team has been putting a great deal of effort into merging the two PDF components we offered, and improving the mechanism along the way. The main motivators for the merger of both Aspose.Pdf for .NET and Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET were the suggestions and the requirements we have been receiving from you for quite some time.

As the merged version is [out now][2], we think, this is the right time to put together a list of the major benefits you're going to get by migrating to the merged version, and share it with you. So, here are the seven good reasons to migrate to the merged Aspose.Pdf for .NET

## 1\. One Component for Creating and Editing PDF Files

Aspose.Pdf for .NET and Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET have been merged into a single component -- Aspose.Pdf for .NET. You will have to manage and upgrade only a single component for creating and editing PDF files in future.

## 2\. New DOM Based API

In addition to retaining existing interfaces in the merged component, we have introduced a new DOM based API as well. This API provides more flexibility while working with the PDF objects. For example, instead of just adding or replacing text, you'll be able to deal with the detailed text and font elements.

## 3\. Improved PDF Engine

The PDF processing mechanism has been improved to provide better results and improved performance. The new merged version contains enhanced text and font rendering mechanism as well.

## 4\. Consistency with other Aspose Products

The new component is consistent with other Aspose products in two aspects. First, a single component provides the facility to create and edit the particular format -- PDF in this case. Second, the DOM API provides the interface similar to the other Aspose products which would be easier to learn and implement.

## 5\. Backward Compatibility

You can migrate your existing applications to the new component with great ease. By retaining the existing interfaces of both of the components intact, we have tried to make sure that your existing code works fine with the merged version as well.

## 6\. Improved Documentation

We have not only reorganized the documentation so that you would be able to locate the required information quickly, but also added many new samples for most of the common scenarios to learn the component quite easily.

## 7\. Separate PDF Components will be Discontinued from October 2011

Retaining the separate components for a long time along with the merged version, might get you confused. So, we'll provide the separate Aspose.Pdf for .NET and Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET versions until September 2011. From October 2011, we'll only provide the merged Aspose.Pdf for .NET. Aspose.Pdf for .NET 6.0.0 and above are the merged versions. We'll provide you any critical fixes in the separate versions before October 2011. One important thing to note here is that all the releases of Aspose.Pdf for .NET with the versions lower than 6.0.0 are part of the separate Aspose.Pdf for .NET.

If you find any questions related to migration or other aspects, please do not hesitate to [let us know][3]. We're looking forward to your success!
