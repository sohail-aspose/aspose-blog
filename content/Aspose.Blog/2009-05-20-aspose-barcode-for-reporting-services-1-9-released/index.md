We have just released Aspose.BarCode for Reporting Services v 1.9. This is a major release which now includes full support for Microsoft SSRS 2008. It is also compatible with 64-bit Windows Operating Systems. In this release we have also updated the design-time property builder of the BarCode control. Matrix 2 of 5 barcode rendering support is also added along with bug fixes in AZTEC barcode generation.
