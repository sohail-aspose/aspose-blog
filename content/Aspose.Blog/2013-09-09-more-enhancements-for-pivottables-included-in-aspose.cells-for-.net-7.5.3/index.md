[![Aspose.Cells for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Cells-for-net_100.png)Aspose.Cells for .NET 7.5.3 has been released. This month’s release includes an enhancement for reading and writing page setup options in HTML files. We have also made several enhancements for rendering, manipulating and refreshing PivotTables.  We have fixed a few exceptions when reading and writing Excel files and manipulating PivotTables in a template file.

In this release, several important issues have been addressed. For example, issues around rendering Excel files, rendering and manipulating PivotTables, rendering image files, converting Excel files to HTML/MTHML file format and exporting to PDF have been resolved. Issues pertaining to the formula calculation engine have also been fixed.

We have made a few enhancements in Aspose.Cells for .NET’s web-based Grid control. For example, GridWeb now includes more features and attributes in the undo operation. We have fixed an issue regarding freeze panes in IE10 in GridWeb. We have also improved performance regarding formulas calculation in Aspose.Cells for .NET’s desktop-based Grid control when working with bigger Excel files which have lots of formulas.
