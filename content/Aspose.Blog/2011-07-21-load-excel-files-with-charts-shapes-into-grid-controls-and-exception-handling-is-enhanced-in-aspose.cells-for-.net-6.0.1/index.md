We have just released the Aspose.Cells for .NET v6.0.1. In this hot fix, we have made several enhancements regarding Exception Handling and Chartâ€™s Formatting modules. The performance is enhanced regarding Printing Worksheets and Worksheet-to-Image features.

The grid controls (GridDesktop and GridWeb) provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET, now, support to load Excel files having charts and shapes. The desktop control allows you to export MS Excel 2007 files with more than 256 columns.

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
