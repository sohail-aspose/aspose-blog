We have released the Aspose.Cells for Java v2.4.2 for the users.

In this version, we have enhanced different features and internal modules, e.g. Excel to PDF, Reading/Saving Excel (97-2007) Files, Chart to Image etc. Now, you may include Array parameters while setting custom formulas. Moreover, you may insert linked pictures to your worksheet. The component, now also supports to save Cells data directly to stream/disk without building entire data model into the memory that always consumes a lot of memory.

There are some other fixes and enhancements too.
