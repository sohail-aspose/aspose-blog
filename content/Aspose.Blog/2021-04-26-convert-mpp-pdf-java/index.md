## Convert MPP to PDF File Programmatically with Java {#section2}

You can convert MPP file to PDF with the following steps:

1.  Load input file using [Project][10] class.
2.  Save output PDF file using [Save()][11] method and [SaveFileFormat][12] enumeration.

The following code shows how to convert MPP file to PDF programmatically using Java:

## MPP to PDF Conversion with Advanced Options in Java {#section3}

You can customize and control the MPP to PDF file conversion with several properties exposed by the [PdfSaveOptions][13] class. For instance, you can specify legends, time scale, row height, etc. The following steps show how to perform MPP file conversion to PDF format:

1.  Load input Microsoft Project File.
2.  Initialize [SaveOptions][14] class object.
3.  Specify different properties.
4.  Save output PDF document.

The following code shows how to convert MPP to PDF with advanced options programmatically using Java:

{{< gist aspose-com-gists 23aa343d20cceae373dedb9319d43446 "Convert-MPP-PDF-Advance-Options.java" >}}

## Convert MPP file to Encrypted and Password Protected PDF File using Java {#section4}

Some projects may include sensitive data for an organization so you may prefer to protect the information in output PDF file. So you can encrypt and password protect the PDF document. Please follow the steps below to secure output PDF file after MPP conversion:

1.  Load input MPP file with Project class.
2.  Initialize [PdfEncryptionDetails][15] class object while specifying user and owner passwords.
3.  Initialize [PdfSaveOptions][16] class object.
4.  Save the output PDF file.

The code below explains how to convert MPP file to a password protected and encrypted PDF file programmatically using Java:
