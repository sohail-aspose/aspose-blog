We are pleased to announce that Aspose.OCR for Java 3.6.0 is now available for public use. This release includes an improved mechanism for skewed image correction. A faster image rotation algorithm has also been incorporated in this release.

## Enhancements

Skew image correction functionality was already supported in the form of the getSkewDegree method. However, the skew image correction process has been improved further. Similarly, the image can be rotated using Aspose.OCR but rotation algorithm has been improved further. Method com.aspose.omr.OmrEngine.rotateImage(com.aspose.omr.OmrImage, double) has been introduced.

*   Angle of rotation calculation process has been improved.
*   Textblock recognition deskewed image process has been improved.
*   Deskew confirmation in OMR template editor has been improved.

Please review the release notes of [Aspose.OCR for Java 3.6.0][1] for a complete view of new enhancements.
