Aspose.Diagram for .NET 1.9.0 has been released. This release includes support for creating diagrams from scratch. You can now add masters from stencils, templates or other diagrams and set properties of newly added shapes in your diagrams using Aspose.Diagram for .NET's very simple API.

In this release, we have improved several XML, PDF, image and XPS rendering features. Some important fixes have also been included.
