[PLT][2] is a vector-based format used for plotter machines. However, only a few applications support this format so you might need to convert to more compatible formats as per your requirements. You can **convert PLT files to PDF, PNG, or JPEG images** with few quick and simple steps. Let us learn the following sections for more details:

*   [PLT to PDF or JPEG Converter – API Installation][3]
*   [Convert PLT to PDF File in C#][4]
*   [Convert PLT to JPEG Image in C#][5]

## PLT to PDF or JPEG Converter – API Installation {#section1}

[Aspose.CAD for .NET][6] API can process a lot of CAD drawings like DWG, DXF, and many other [supported file formats][7]. You can process PLT files easily without getting into minor details because the API takes care of all factors. You can configure the API by downloading it from [official Downloads][8], or via the following [NuGet][9] installation command:

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.CAD
```

## Convert PLT to PDF File in C# {#section2}

PLT file conversion is helpful in scenarios like when you want to quickly preview the file for review, approval, etc. A compatible and popular file format for such scenarios is PDF file. You can convert PLT to PDF files with a couple of steps as listed below:

1.  Load input PLT file
2.  Set different properties for [CadRasterizationOptions][10]
3.  Specify [PdfOptions][11] for rendering
4.  Convert PLT to PDF file and save output document

The following code snippet is based on these steps which explains how to convert PLT File to PDF document in C# Programmatically:

## Convert PLT to JPEG Image in C# {#section3}

You can easily convert a PLT file to JPEG image programmatically using C# language. This feature can be helpful in the use cases like when you want to enrich your applications with PLT Previewing feature. You can convert PLT to JPEG image with the following steps:

1.  Load input PLT file
2.  Initialize [JpegOptions][12] class instance
3.  Specify [CadRasterizationOptions][13] properties
4.  Convert PLT to JPEG image format and save the output file

The code below shows how to convert PLT to JPEG image using C# language:
