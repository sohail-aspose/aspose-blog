**Sydney, Australia** \- DDD Sydney is a full day non profit community event run by developers for developers. Topics include .NET, Java and Cloud based technologies. Anyone can submit a session to the event and delegates then vote on the sessions they want to see.

We're developers ourselves and understand the desire to focus on the interesting stuff like learning new technologies and implementing new features. User groups are great way to feed that desire and that's why we are keen to sponsor developer events in the community such as **DDD Sydney**. Check them out:
