[![Aspose.3D for NET APIs][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/10/Aspose.3d-for-net-100x100.png)

[](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/10/Aspose.3d-for-net-100x100.png)We’re pleased to announce the availability of [new version 1.7.0 of Aspose.3D for .NET API][2]. This new version adds a variety of new features for developers. Aspose.3D API now allows developers to take a picture of 3D model with an active camera object, gets shadow from light to assist in receiving shadows on geometries, calculate normals for all meshes in any 3D model and combine quaternions to represent a sequence of transformations. Besides this, it covers regular bug fixes and enhancements that should help developers in everyday development. For more details please take a look at the Release Notes. As always, we welcome feedbacks from our clients. For problems, please let us know by posting in the [Aspose.3D forum][3].

## Render an Image of 3D Model from an Active Camera

Aspose.3D for .NET helps turning individual ideas into beautiful 3D models and prototypes for a variety of fields. After building a 3D model, developers may capture a partial view to compute an image as seen by the camera object. They can also set the camera position and target to capture the required view. This help topic shows how developers can render a view of the 3D model to an image format: Render an Image of 3D Model from the Camera

## Cast and Receive Shadows on 3D Geometries

Light and shadow are two separate things in 3D engines, although we perceive them together in real life. Lighting means that an object is brighter on the side facing the light direction, and darker on the backside. Lighting does not mean that objects cast a shadow on the floor or other objects. Activating shadow processing is an additional step. This help topic shows how developers can cast and receive shadows on 3D geometries: Cast and Receive Shadows on 3D Geometries

## Calculate Normals for a Mesh

Aspose.3D API allows developers to calculate normals of a mesh. Some of 3D file formats can't store accurate vertex normals. Using Aspose.3D API, developers may import a 3D file, and then iterate through the meshes of 3D model and generate normal data. This help topic shows how developers can calculate and store normals: Generate Normal Data for All Meshes in a 3D File

## Combine Quaternions and Apply on 3D Geometries

Quaternions are used to represent an orientation in 3D space. Developers may combine quaternions and therefore create rotations based on a hierarchy of joints. Using Aspose.3D API, developers can combine two quaternions and apply them to 3D geometries. This help topic shows how to achieve this: Combine Quaternions and Apply them to 3D Geometries

We have also fixed the error which occurred on loading a U3D file. Please check a list of the resolved defects:

*   Fixed: Add support of converting STL to an image format.
    
*   Fixed: Render the scene to a texture.
    
*   Fixed: Add support of shadow.
    
*   Fixed: Generate normal data from smoothing group.
    
*   Fixed: Index out of range error occurred on loading a U3D file.
