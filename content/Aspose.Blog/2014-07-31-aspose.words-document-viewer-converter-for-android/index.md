Developing applications on the **Android** platform can be challenging if you need to integrate multiple features of the OS into your app, while also taking care of your main task. [**Document Viewer & Converter for Android**][1] is an open-source **Word document viewer app** that uses [Aspose.Words for Android][2] to asynchronously generate images of each page from documents to render. It also keeps them in the cache to prevent regeneration. The app can also **convert Microsoft Word documents** into various formats.

## Word Document Viewer and Converter App for Android

The app can open documents from external storage and Dropbox. Any other application that requires a viewer for Word documents can also send requests to open a document.

You can view the following documents using **Document Viewer & Converter for Android**.

*   Microsoft Word 2003 documents (DOC)
*   Microsoft Word 2007 documents (DOCX)
*   OpenOffice/LibreOffice OpenDocument Text files (ODT)
*   Rich Text Format (RTF)

## View Document from Storage

To open the file from the device storage or SD Card, tap on the folder icon on the main screen. Browse to the folder and tap on the desired document. You can select any of the supported documents.

## View Document from Dropbox

You may need an internet connection to download files from Dropbox.
