[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/09/Java-Logo-small.png)The Thailand JVM User group a Java & JVM user group held in Bangkok focusing on the JVM technology stack.

The group is very friendly and help beginners get started and CTOs to get smarter. That's how the THJUG community works.

Their next meetup is on the topic of Functional Programming. The tech scene in Bangkok is screaming for developers and the THJUG helps drag them out from universities and every other cave they live in to get them to open their eyes and see how much the world has to offer them.

Aspose loves getting behind local user groups which is why we are are proud to be a of the Thailand JVM User Group.
