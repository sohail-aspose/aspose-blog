We have created a video tutorial for the users. TheÂ video exhibits how to convert an excel file to PDF format using Aspose.Cells APIs. In this video, we create a simple Windows application to demonstrate the task. We load / open an excel file, and then convert it to PDF format. The generated PDF file can be opened into Adobe Reader.
