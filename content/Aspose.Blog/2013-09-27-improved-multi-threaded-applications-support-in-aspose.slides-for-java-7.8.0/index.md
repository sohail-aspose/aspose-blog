[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-Java_100.png)We'd like to present Aspose.Slides for for Java 7.8.0. This is mainly a maintenance release where we have improved the capability to work in multi-threaded environments. Many multi-threaded presentation rendering issues have been addressed in this release. We have also improved the presentation rendering support in terms of generating slide thumbnails and exporting presentation to PDF and TIFF.
