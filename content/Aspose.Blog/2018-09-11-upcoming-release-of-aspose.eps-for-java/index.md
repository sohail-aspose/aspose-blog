We at Aspose are pleased to announce upcoming release of [Aspose.EPS for Java][1]. As Aspose.EPS for .NET has recently been released, we are about to introduce Java API in Aspose.EPS Product Family. Currently, we are working over porting features from previously released .NET API and will be going to release first version of Aspose.EPS for Java API as soon as porting is completed. Like all other Java APIs offered by Aspose, this upcoming API will also be available for download over Aspose Artifactory and API Downloads Section.

First version of the API will consist of similar feature set as earlier released .NET API has. It will be offering only converters, in order to perform inter-file formats conversion i.e. PS/EPS to PDF. In upcoming releases of the API, we will be adding more features e.g. PDF to EPS/PS and EPS/PS to image conversion.

## First Version Availability

Along with testing the API and getting it ready to be released, we are also working over completing its documentation and feature examples in Java. Like all other Java APIs offered by Aspose, Aspose.EPS for Java would also come with complete user guide and demo Java code snippet(s) which will help you get familiar with API conveniently. In order to keep yourself updated with the news on Aspose.EPS for Java release, stay tuned with us. In case of any question or inquiry, you can please reach us over [Aspose.EPS Support Forums][2]. We will be more than happy to entertain your queries accordingly.
