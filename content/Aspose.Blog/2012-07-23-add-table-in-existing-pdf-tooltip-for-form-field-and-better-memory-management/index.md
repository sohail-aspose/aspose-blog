![Aspose.Pdf icon][1]

We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Pdf for .NET 7.1.0][2]. This new release version provides a long awaited feature to add a table inside an existing PDF document. With the introduction of this feature Aspose.Pdf for .NET can add a table while generating PDF document from scratch, and it supports adding tables inside existing PDF documents. This release version also supports the feature to add a tooltip to a form field. But that's not all. We have also added a feature that allows you to convert a linearized file into a non-linearized document (and vice-versa: convert a non-linearized file into a linearized document).

We've made text and image extraction features more stable. Furthermore, we have greatly improved the image and text stamping feature. The feature to convert PDF files into PDF/A format has also been improved. Please note that in this release, we have specifically focused on memory management when dealing with existing PDF documents.
