This release officially introduces our new technology of smart export of reports to Microsoft Word documents called _AWesomeExport._ Currently it allows to convert tables and matrices in original reports to "native" tables in Microsoft Word documents (rather than to a bunch of textboxes) which makes the output much more natural and easy to edit. Note this behaviour is enabled by default starting with this release. To learn how to turn it off if needed, please consult the online or offline documentation of the product.

This release also includes some minor fixes requested by customers such as the correct support of hard breaks when exporting to tables using _AWesomeExport_.
