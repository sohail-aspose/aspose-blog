Aspose.Cells provides the feature to create named ranges using simple Aspose.Cells APIs.

We created a demo video for the users to show the implementation of this feature. In this video, we will create a simple WinForm application to demonstrate the task. We will add two named ranges i.e. one workbook scoped named range and second worksheet scoped named range using Aspose.Cells APIs.
