We have released Aspose.Tasks for .NET 3.0.0 with enhanced capability of MPP Project data rendering to Gantt Chart Image as well as HTML. Now, damaged MPP files can also be read through Aspose.Tasks for .NET. Moreover, plain text from RTF Notes can be parsed. In addition, a number of bugs have been fixed.
