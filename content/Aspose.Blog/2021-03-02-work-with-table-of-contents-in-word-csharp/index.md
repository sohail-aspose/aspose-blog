## C# API to Work with TOC in Word Document {#API-to-Work-with-TOC-in-Word-Document}

In order to work with tables of contents in Word documents, we will use [Aspose.Words for .NET][9]. The said API is designed to perform basic as well as advanced Word automation features from within .NET applications. Furthermore, it gives you a sound grip over the manipulation of table of contents in Word documents. You can either [download][10] the API or install it using [NuGet][11].

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.Words
```

## Add Table of Contents in a Word Document using C# {#Add-Table-of-Content-in-Word-Document}

The following are the steps to add a table of contents to Word document using Aspose.Words for .NET.

*   Create an instance of the [Document][12] class (in case of loading an existing Word document, provide the file's path in the constructor).
*   Create an instance of [DocumentBuilder][13] class and initialize it with the _Document_ object created earlier.
*   Insert table of contents using [DocumentBuilder.InsertTableOfContents("\\\\o \\"1-3\\" \\\\h \\\\z \\\\u")][14] method.
*   Update the fields using [Document.UpdateFields()][15] method.
*   Save the Word document using [Document.Save(String)][16] method.

The following code sample shows how to add a table of contents in a Word document in C#.

## Extract Table of Contents from a Word Document using C# {#Extract-Table-of-Content-in-Word-Document}

The following are the steps to extract fields from a table of contents in a Word document.

*   Load the Word document using the [Document][17] class.
*   Loop through each [Field][18] in the document using [Document.Range.Fields][19] collection.
*   Check if the field type is a hyperlink using [Field.Type][20] property.
*   Check if the field comes under the table of the contents section.
*   Retrieve the information of the field and print it.

## Update Table of Contents in Word Document using C# {#Update-Table-of-Content-in-Word-Document}

Whenever you append some content to a Word document, you need to update the table of contents. In order to do it programmatically, you simply need to call [Document.UpdateFields()][21] method before saving the document.

## Remove Table of Contents in Word Document using C# {#Remove-Table-of-Contents-in-Word-Document}

Aspose.Words for .NET also allows you to remove the table of contents from a Word document. The following are the steps to perform this operation.

*   First, load the Word document using the [Document][22] class.
*   Get and store the [FieldStart][23] nodes of each TOC in an array.
*   Loop through the nodes until you get the node of type [FieldEnd][24] (end of the TOC).
*   Remove the nodes using [Node.Remove()][25] method and save the updated document.
