We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.CAD for .NET 1.0.0. This is a new addition to Aspose APIs and allows you to work with CAD formats including DWG and DXF formats. Aspose.Imaging also supports CAD formats but these formats will be removed from Aspose.Imaging in the next three months and all features related to CAD formats will be the part of Aspose.CAD only.

This release of Aspose.CAD for .NET supports [converting DWG and DXF formats to PDF][1] and [raster image formats][2]. Converting CAD [layers][3] and [layouts][4] to PDF and [raster image formats][5] has also been supported by this release. You can also remove entities from DWG and DXF documents.
