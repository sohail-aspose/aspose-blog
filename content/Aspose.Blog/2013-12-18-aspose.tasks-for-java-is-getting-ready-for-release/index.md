[![Aspose.Tasks for Java logo][1]Aspose.Tasks for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/tasks/net) has been in the field for quite a long time now and is used to programmatically create, read and manipulate Microsoft Project documents (MPP/XML) without installing Microsoft Project. It is the only API available that lets .NET application developers provide project document processing capabilities in their web and desktop applications entirely without Microsoft Office Automation.

# Coming Soon: Aspose.Tasks for Java

Our customers have asked for Aspose.Tasks on Java and we are pleased to share that this API will soon be launched. The API will enable Java application developers to include project document processing functionality in their applications without worrying about the underlying complexity of the Microsoft Project file format.

# Based on Aspose.Tasks for .NET

Asopse.Tasks for Java has been built on top of Aspose.Tasks for .NET and inherits almost all of the features and capabilities of that product. Aspose.Tasks for Java will allow developers to manipulate Microsoft Project 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013 MPP as well as XML files, and provide control over various stages of project management, such as project planning, definition and tracking. The API will also provide full control over a project’s tasks, resources, resource assignments and extended attributes. In addition, Aspose.Tasks for Java will allow developers to manage task baselines and actual work, access assignment costs and budgets, and managing resource costs and variances for project tracking. In addition, it supports rendering a project’s tasks, resources, and resource assignment data to various formats such as PDF, TIFF, BMP, and others. The upcoming Aspose.Tasks for Java API, however, will not support printing for now. Printing features will be provided later on.

# Stay Tuned

Aspose.Tasks for Java will prove itself as powerful at project document processing as Aspose.Tasks for .NET . It is due for release in the near future and anyone who wants to use the capabilities of Aspose.Tasks in their Java applications won’t have to wait long.

If you have any queries related to features or functionality, share them with us in the [Aspose.Tasks forum][2].
