We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.BarCode for .NET 6.4.0. For this release the QR code recognition feature has been improved. As usual, it’s fast, accurate and easy to use, works in 32 bit & 64 bit environments. In sum, the QR recognition engine, utilizes image recognition in a whole new way in that it gets better and better at cognition results as we process more and more images. This new release offers fast and accurate reading of QR code.

Two fixes are made to recognize QR code correctly from TIFF and JPG formats. A customer was not able to recognize QR codes from TIFF images because the Read method was taking too long. This issue also lead to performance and memory consumption problems. The second issue was about recognizing QR codes in a noisy JPG image. We have fixed both issues in this new release.
