Anybody using **bool Node.HasInnerText**? Let me know if you are.

We are planning to extend the public API with auto shapes soon and we cannot go without critically looking at the existing API. The Node.HasInnerText property is just one of the few members that now seem like not adding much value to the API and we consider removing it.

Also, let us know (here or in the forums) if you have any questions or suggestions about the public API. Something you would like added, removed or changed in the API? It might be a good time to voice it now.
