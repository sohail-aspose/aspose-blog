We are pleased to present the release of Aspose.Slides for .NET 14.5.0. This is a major product release in which we have included some new features and have stabilized many existing ones.

## New Features

We have introduced much-requested features for adding, inserting, and updating group shapes on slides. Previously, it was only possible to update group shapes already in a presentation by accessing them. But now, it is possible to create group shapes from scratch and add new shapes to group shape collection. For more details about the supported features, please visit the documentation article [Working With Group Shapes][1].

We have also added support for identifying if a presentation is password protected or not without even loading the presentation.

## Resolved Issues

We have enhanced the presentation rendering support and have resolved issues related to improper tables, SmartArt, text and chart rendering in generated slide thumbnails and exported PDF files. We have resolved issues pertaining to accessing and saving presentations that resulted in different exceptions in earlier product versions. Issues of corrupted presentation files generated have also been addressed in this release.

The slide cloning support has also been improved by rectifying issues of cloning slides with video and charts on them. The issue of wrong layout slide applied during slide cloning has also been rectified in this release.

We have enhanced chart support in this release and have resolved issues related to setting the chart category direction, formatting chart labels, setting font-related properties for different chart entities, and radar chart support.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please visit the documentation article [Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for .NET 14.5.0][2] for further reference.
