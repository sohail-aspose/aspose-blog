[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-Java_100.png)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for Java 15.9.0. This is one of maintenance releases in which we have resolved certain issues incurring in the product along with support for some new features.

## New Features

We have introduced the feature for rendering the slide to graphics. Now, a slide could be rendered to a specified Graphics2D object because renderToGraphics method has been added to ISlide interface and Slide class. We have also improved the document rendering with respect to OpenOffice because there were some discrepancies which have now been rectified in this release. Please visit the documentation article Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for Java 15.9.0 for further reference.

## Resolved Issues

Many issues related to presentation rendering to different file formats have been fixed in this release. Issues related to missing charts, missing text and changed font color have also been rectified. Support for setting the header and footer on notes and handout view has been enhanced and now programmers can work with header and footer without any issue.

A very critical issue related to ExceptionInInitializerError exception being thrown while loading and saving some presentations in Unix and Solaris environments has also addressed in this release. Few other issues reported for the exceptions including NoClassDefFoundError, PptxReadException , NegativeSeekOffset and PptException have been fixed as well.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Refer to the article Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for Java 15.9.0 for further reference.
