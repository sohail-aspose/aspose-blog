## FBX to GLB File Converter – Java API Installation

To convert FBX to GLB file format, you need to configure [Aspose.3D for Java][5] API. It is a 3D file processing API that supports working with 3D scenes as you can create, edit, or manipulate many 3D file formats including FBX, GLB, and [other file formats][6]. You can easily configure the API by downloading its JAR file from the [Downloads][7] section, or with the following Maven specifications in pom.xml file of your project:
