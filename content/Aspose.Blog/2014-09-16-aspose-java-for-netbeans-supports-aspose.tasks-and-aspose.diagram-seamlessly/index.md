[Aspose.Tasks for Java][2] is a project management API that enables Java application developers to provide Microsoft Project® document manipulation capability in their applications – all without using Microsoft Project®. With this powerful API, developers can control various stages of project management, such as project planning, definition and tracking.

#### **Aspose.Diagram for Java**

[Aspose.Diagram for Java][3] is a Non-Graphical and well-structured API that allows developers to load, create, save, and manipulate Microsoft Visio drawings within a Java application without using Microsoft Visio. It provides better performance and is easier to use to manipulate diagrams and convert files than Microsoft Office Automation.
