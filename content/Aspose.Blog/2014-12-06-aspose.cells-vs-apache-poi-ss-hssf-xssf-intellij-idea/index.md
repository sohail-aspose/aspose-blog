Aspose has now integrated the examples of [Aspose.Cells for Java][1] code and a features comparison with Apache POI SS (HSSF + XSSF) in [Aspose Project Wizard for IntelliJ IDEA][2].

After this both Aspose.Words vs Apache POI WP and Aspose.Cells vs Apache POI SS are available in Aspose Project Wizard from version 1.3Â  onwards.

With this integration you now don't need to manually download the  [Aspose Java APIs code comparison examples with Apache POI framework][3] as they are now available through the plugin's Aspose New Example wizard within your favourite IntelliJ IDEA.

Comparison examples shows side by side code comparison for features available in both Aspose.Cells and Apache POI SS (HSSF & XSSF).

## How to Create the Aspose.Cells Features Comparison Example with Apache POI within IntelliJ IDEA

1.  Create an Aspose application using the Aspose Project wizard (detailed steps are mentioned in previous Aspose blog post). In the wizard, select Aspose.Cells component like shown in below snap shot: ![Aspose Project Wizard][4]
2.  Create new Aspose example from the **New** option in IntelliJ IDEA (detailed steps are given in a previous [Aspose blog post][5].
3.  Select the Aspose.Cells component from the selection box.  
    Examples are downloaded and will appear in tree format including Aspose.Cells code comparison examples with Apache POI SS as shown in below snapshot:![](http://i.imgur.com/WpEQvCo.png)
