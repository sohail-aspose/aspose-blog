We are pleased to share the release announcement of Aspose.Slides for JasperReports 2.1.0.

This release has been built on the basis of latest Aspose.Slides for Java API and supports JasperReports versions ranging from 3.5.0 through 5.5.0 for exporting to PowerPoint presentations. We have made this release more compatible with JBoss6 and now reports can be generated without any issue. We have also addressed the report rendering issues which were incurring while exporting reports to PPTX format.
