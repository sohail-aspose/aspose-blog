## Are your products up to date?

Welcome to the February 2013 newsletter! This month, we share tips and tricks on how to work with Aspose.Cells for .NET, Aspose.Words for Java and Aspose.Pdf for .NET. We hope you find them useful.

If you have not updated your products recently, this is a good time to do so. We released a lot of updates in December and early January: install them to work with the best possible version of your products. Updates are free with a valid subscription. [Go to the download page][1].

We're quickly approaching 200,000 registered users and are planning to celebrate this milestone with prizes. Keep an eye on [our blog][2] for updates.

Thank you for reading,  
Danny Cooper, Aspose Texas Team Leader
