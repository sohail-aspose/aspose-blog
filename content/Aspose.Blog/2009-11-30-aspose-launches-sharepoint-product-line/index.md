**Australia, Sydney - November 30, 2009** \- Aspose has decided to add SharePoint to the platforms that they support. The first component to be launched on this platform is Aspose’s most popular product, Aspose.Words.

Aspose.Words for SharePoint is the first product of its kind on the components market. It makes it possible for software developers to open, convert and combine Microsoft Word and other popular word processing files from within their SharePoint applications. Developers can now offer their users high-fidelity file conversion and highly effective document management. Aspose.Words for SharePoint helps make developers deliver value for their businesses by helping colleagues to seamlessly share and archive important business intelligence.
