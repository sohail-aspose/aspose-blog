Dear Customers,  
  
We have released Aspose.Slides for Java 1.6.0.0.  
  
The main new feature of this release is support for Wmf/Emf metafiles. It's possible to add metafiles to slides now.  
To work with metafiles you have to purchase our new "Aspose.Metafiles for Java" library.  
  
Both placeable and non-placeable wmf metafiles are supported as well as any emf files.  
Creating thumbnail of a slide with metafiles is coming soon.  
  
Also fixed problem with PP2003 SP2 when it couldn't open presentation if any slides with notes had been deleted.
