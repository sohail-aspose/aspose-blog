 [![Aspose.BarCode for JasperReports][1]](https://products.aspose.com/barcode/jasperreports) We are pleased to announce new Aspose.BarCode for JasperReports 18.4 release.

This release has been developed based on Aspose.BarCode for Java 18.4, whereby we have fixed the issue related to exception handling in Aspose.BarCode API. It was observed that API generates barcode successfully even if invalid text is supplied. The exception handling process has been improved in such way that **ThrowExceptionWhenCodeTextIncorrect** property is set and an incorrect text is supplied for encode types SwissPostParcel, SingaporePost and Databars, it will throw **codetext is invalid** exception.

To view a complete list of fixes, please visit [Aspose.Barcode for JasperReport 18.4 release notes][2] page.
