PUB (Publisher) file format is used for professional designs like newsletters, brochures and posters. They may also be used to integrate and store data sources for mail merges and generating datasheets. Since Aspose has been offering file format APIs specialized to perform inter-file format conversions, perform operations over files like creation, edition, manipulation, etc. -Â  we are honored to announce an upcoming API i.e. [Aspose.PUB for .NET][1]. By the name of this API, it is easy to guess this will be used to deal with PUB files. Let's look over the features it will be offering with its very first release and have some insights over its schedule of availability.

## Features of Aspose.PUB for .NET

In the first release of the API, you will be able to convert PUB to PDF. A separate API dedicated only for publisher files would be very usable and handy for the developers who are only interested in working with PUB files and convert PUB to PDF functionality.

## Availability of First Release

We intend to release first version of Aspose.PUB for .NET in October 2019 if all integration and internal testing phase goes well. We will surely be announcing its first release with complete guide on how to use and configure it in your applications. Until then, [stay tuned][2] for every update about Aspose APIs and feel free to post your inquiries over our [forums][3] in case you have some. We will be more than happy to assist you accordingly.
