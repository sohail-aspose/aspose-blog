We are happy to present Aspose.Words for Java 3.2.

This release includes over 200 fixes and enhancements.

There are many enhancements in handling of DOCX, ODT and HTML documents. Most of these changes are copies of changes made earlier in the .NET version of Aspose.Words.

But there are also some Java specific improvements. There are performance improvements when dealing with DOCX, ODT, HTML documents and images. For example, in one test, loading an HTML document with images that are stored remotely has improved by the factor of 100.

To see the complete list of changes and to download the new release see [Aspose.Words download][1].
