[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We are glad to share our new release Aspose.Slides for .NET 7.9.0. In this release we have made many improvements. We've implemented support for setting a relative picture frame size as available in Microsoft PowerPoint. Please visit the documentation for an example. We have also made great improvement towards SmartArt rendering support and many issues encountered when rendering presentations with SmartArt shapes have been rectified. We have also addressed performance related issues and have made some good improvements in this area. Many PDF and thumbnail generation issues involving charts, tables and text have also been rectified.
