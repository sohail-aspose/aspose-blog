We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Imaging for Java 17.6. This is a major release in which we have implemented the support for exporting raster image to SVG along with support for setting replacement for missing fonts in images. We have also included the long-awaited support for the JPEG-LS image format as well in this release.

The following features have been introduced in this release.

*   [Support for Raster Image to SVG Conversion][1].
*   [Provide setting for replacing missing fonts][2].
*   [Support for JPEG-LS format][3].
*   [Support for JPEG-LS with CMYK, YCCK color modes][4].
