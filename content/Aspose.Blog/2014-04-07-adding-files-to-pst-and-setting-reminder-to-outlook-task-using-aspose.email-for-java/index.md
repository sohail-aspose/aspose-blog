We are pleased to share that Aspose.Email for Java 4.0.0 has been released. As always, we have put our best efforts to not only fix the issues that our customers reported for the previous version, but also include a number of enhancements as well.

# Adding Reminder Information to Outlook Tasks

Aspose.Email for Java already supported creating, saving and updating an Outlook Task. Microsoft Outlook allows adding reminder information to the created task which then triggers at the specified time and reminds the user for the activity. This month’s release of Aspose.Email for Java further enhances the MapiTask properties by providing support for adding reminder information to the created task. This includes:

*   Setting reminder time for the task
*   Specifying the audible file name that is played as reminder
*   Reading reminder information from a MapiTask

# Adding Files to PST

Aspose.Email provides vast variety of operations when it comes to work with Personal Storage (PST) files. Talking about the list of items that can be added to a PST file, it already supports adding messages, tasks, journal and notes to the PST file. This month’s release introduces a new feature of adding files to a PST folder in addition to the above mentioned Outlook items. Similar to Outlook, our API now allows to adding files to a PST and that too without installing Microsoft Outlook.

In addition to the enhancements, this month’s release also includes a number of bug fixes related to message encoding, message attachments, message conversions to other formats and PST. For more information on what is new and fixed, please visit the [product download][2] page.
