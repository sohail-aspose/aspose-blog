[![Aspose.3D for NET APIs][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/10/Aspose.3d-for-net-100x100.png)

[](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/10/Aspose.3d-for-net-100x100.png)We’re pleased to announce the availability of new version 1.4.0 of the Aspose.3D for .NET API. This version covers the full export of Universal 3D files and also mends its import into the unified model of Aspose.3D API, this unified model represents all supported 3D file types. To triangulate a mesh of 3D model, we have enhanced internal mapping of the elements because the previous version 1.3.0 was losing the vertex element data partially. It also allows developers to read 3D files using various constructors of the Scene class.

## Save a Universal 3D File

This export feature allows to save 3D model in the Universal 3D file format, including meshes, materials, hierarchy, lights, cameras, animation and skeletons (bones), etc. Since it is simple for the developers to add import and export functionality in their software applications. This article explains how to save all supported 3D files: Save a 3D Document

## Protect Vertex Element Data while Triangulating a Mesh

This version gives protection to the vertex element data during the conversion of a 3D scene mesh to the triangle mesh. We also gradually add support of new 3D formats which demands to keep the latest changes. In reference to this enhancement, we don't need to change the interface of existing API because it is an internal change. This help topic shows how developers can triangulate a mesh: How to Triangulate a Mesh

## Read a Universal 3D File

We have enhanced the reading support of Universal 3D files. In the previous version 1.3.0, we added its support and it was limited to the specific U3D elements. Since it is a stable version for this particular area as well. This help topic shows how developers can open U3D file using Aspose.3D API: Reading a 3D Scene

## Public API Changes

The following API changes in the new version are also worth noting:

*   The new Universal3DConfig class is added - It specifies the save and load options of Universal 3D document.
