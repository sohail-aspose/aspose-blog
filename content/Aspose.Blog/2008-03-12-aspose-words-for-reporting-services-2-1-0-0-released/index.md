It's been around a year since we released the first version of Aspose.Words for Reporting Services, and now 2.1 is coming. A rendering extension is not a standalone program, it's rather somewhat like a plug-in, and the goals of a plug-in are to

*   be as easy to install, configure and maintain as possible
*   do its job as good as possible.

We truly hope we've achieved these goals. However, we keep working hard on the product in order to make it even closer to perfection. There are always lots of things to investigate and implement, especially in the area of format conversion.

The new release is available to download at [http://www.aspose.com/community/files/52/ssrs-rendering-extensions/aspose.words.reporting.services/default.aspx][1]
