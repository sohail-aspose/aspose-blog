Welcome to the July 2012 edition of the Saaspose Newsletter. This newsletter highlights the information about latest updates in APIs, exciting new features and the informative blogs.![](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/06/hori_line.1.png)

![](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/06/tip.png)**Tip of the Month: Monitor API Usage with Apps** You can create multiple Apps from the Saaspose web UI. These Apps allow you to track your API calls separately. You can use different Apps for different applications you are working with or even for different parts of your application. This allows you to [monitor the API usage][1] appropriately and you can filter the usage logs with the help of these Apps. You can also filter the usage data by a particular API as well. ![](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/06/hori_line.1.png)
