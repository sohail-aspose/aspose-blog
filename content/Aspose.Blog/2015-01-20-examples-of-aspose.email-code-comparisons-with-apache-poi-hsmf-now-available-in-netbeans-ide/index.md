[](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/06/aspose_slides-for-java.png)![][1][![][2]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/11/netbeans-logox801.png)Aspose has now integrated the examples of Aspose.Email for Java code and a features comparison with Apache POI HSMF in [Aspose Project Wizard for NetBeans IDE][3].

After this Aspose.Words vs Apache POI WP, Aspose.Slides vs Apache POI SL, Aspose.Cells vs Apache POI SS and Aspose.Email vs Apache POI HSMF are available in Aspose Project Wizard from version 2.3 and onwards.

With this integration you don't need to manually download the [Aspose Java APIs code comparison examples with Apache POI framework][4] as they are now available through the plugin's Aspose New Example wizard within NetBeans IDE.

Comparison examples shows side by side code comparison for features available in both Aspose.Email and Apache POI HSMF.
