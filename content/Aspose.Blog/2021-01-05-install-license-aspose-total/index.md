[Aspose.Total][2] is a complete set of APIs to work with different files. It lets you create, edit, convert, or manipulate hundreds of file formats. You can purchase and work with different Aspose APIs as a consolidated package, Aspose.Total. You can install or apply licenses for several APIs in Aspose.Total. Let us take a look at the following sections:

*   [Apply License to Aspose.Total API][4]

## Install Aspose.Total API {#section1}

We frequently publish all Aspose APIs as a single package named Aspose.Total. It is the combination of the latest available versions for all Aspose APIs. It is available with the following names for respective platforms.

*   Aspose.Total for .NET
*   Aspose.Total for Java
*   Aspose.Total for C++
*   Aspose.Total for Android via Java
*   Aspose.Total for SharePoint
*   Aspose.Total for Reporting Services
*   Aspose.Total for JasperReports

You can download the ZIP file for any of these packages from the [official Downloads][5]. Or you can install C++ or .NET package by using [NuGet][6] Package Manager for Solution in Visual Studio IDE.

## Apply License to Aspose.Total API {#section2}

First of all, let us assume that you have already purchased a license or received a free temporary license as explained in the [License Purchase][7] article.

Now you need to set the license for all products.  It is worth mentioning here that you need to **set a license separately for each API**. We recommend fully qualifying the License classes so the compiler knows which API are you referring to. For instance, you can use the following C# code for applying the license for all APIs in Aspose.Total for .NET package:

Moreover, we have created a [sample console application][8] to explain the installation of Aspose.Total for .NET API from NuGet gallery. It also covers applying the license for different APIs. You can download its ZIP file from GitHub or [clone the repository][9] for a quick overview of how to install and work with the APIs.
