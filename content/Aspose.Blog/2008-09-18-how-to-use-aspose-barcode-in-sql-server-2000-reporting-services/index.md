We have updated our documentation with a new article about usage of Aspose.BarCode with Visual Studio 2003 and SQL Server 2000 Reporting Services. Configuring Aspose.BarCode with VS 2005 and SQL 2005 is easy because of design time support. You can easily add the BarCode control on the toolbox and set its properties during design time. But with VS 2003 and SQL Server 2000, we need to do some manual work to get the BarCode on the reports.

The article is provided at

http://www.aspose.com/documentation/ssrs-rendering-extensions/aspose.barcode-for-reporting-services/how-to-use-aspose-barcode-in-sql-server-reporting-services-2000.html.

You will find the configuration steps and a step by step guide to a quick sample that shows the usage of Aspose.BarCode in SQL ServerÂ 2000 Reporting Services and Visual Studio 2003.
