We are happy to announce the release of [Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services][1] 1.9.0. In this release, we have provided support for SQL Server Reporting Services 2012; you may enable the Aspose.Cells.Report.Designer Client Tool provided by Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services and integrate it with Visual Studio for SQL Server Reporting Services 2012 as well.  We have also enhanced the custom-oriented Tab Delimited exporting options.
