[![Aspose.Tasks for Java][1]](http://www.aspose.com/java/project-management-component.aspx)Since the launch of Aspose.Tasks for Java, we have worked to improve the API's functionality. As part of these continuous efforts, Aspose.Tasks for Java 6.3.0 has been released with a number of new features and enhancements.

# Updating and Rescheduling an Uncompleted Project’s Work

Microsoft Project lets users update project tasks and rescheduling uncompleted work. This makes it possible to update the overall project work as completed through a specified date for the entire project or specified tasks only. The uncompleted project work can then be scheduled to start after a specified date. We are pleased to share that this month’s release of Aspose.Tasks supports updating project work and rescheduling uncompleted work through a specified date.

# Improvements with Gantt Chart Rendering

Aspose.Tasks’ project data rendering capabilities enable developers to render project Gantt chart according to various time scale settings. In addition, they can roll up Gantt bars to hide or show Gantt chart bars in the output image. We have further improved the Gantt chart rendering facility with the release of Aspose.Tasks for Java 6.3.0. These enhancements include customizing text with taskbars, aligning cell contents, and sorting tasks by any column.

In addition to these new features and enhancements, the overall API functionality was further improved by fixing a number of bugs such as baseline information that couldn’t be read with some user’s specific files, actual duration and work of a task. For further information about what is new and fixed, please visit Aspose.Tasks’s [product download page][2].
