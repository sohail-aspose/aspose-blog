[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/09/Vjug-small1.png)vJUG24 is a 24 hour non stop virtual Java conference that is streamed online for anyone to attend. The conference will be split into three 8-hour windows covering the Americas, APAC and EMEA and will include regional speakers and regional JUGs participating in every session. The event already has over 1000 RSVPs and normally gains an extra 2000-3000 in views in the days after the event.
