Why do you use NuGet? Apart from being an essential tool for modern development platform, you may bundle it into “packages” that contain compiled code (as DLLs) along with other content needed in the projects that consume these packages. Obviously using the NuGet you can have simple and portable compilation of your codes. Without NuGet, you have to load library for all developers before compiling it on their environments. Surely, for industrialization, it would be simple to have the library on NuGet gallery.

Guys, on some users’ demand, we now provide 64-bits lib (for VS2017) in NuGet repos. Previously we were delivering the library where it can directly work on x86 only.

[Aspose.Cells for C++][1] is a native C++ library that enables C++ developers to create, manipulate and convert spreadsheets programmatically without requiring Office Automation or Microsoft Excel application. Aspose.Cells for C++ supports spreadsheet formats such as MS Excel 97-2003 (XLS), MS Excel 2007-2013/2016 (XLSX, XLSM, XLSB, etc.), Open Office XML and other formats. You may also render images from worksheets and convert MS Excel spreadsheet to PDF format. The API also allows you to create, manipulate and render charts and shapes. Moreover, formula calculations is another good aspect provided by component and you may utilize it. There are some other useful features you might be interested in.

I would recommend you to try the release [Aspose.Cells for C++ v19.3][2]. And, if you have more time, browse [Developers’ Guide][3] for your complete reference on what you can deliver using the API. You are always welcome to share your review, concerns or feedback on forums.
