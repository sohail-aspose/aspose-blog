[Aspose.BarCode for Java][1] is a robust and reliable Java API to read and recognize 1D and 2D barcodes from any image within Java applications. It is available for Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME platforms. Aspose.BarCode for Java supports the most established barcode standards and barcode specifications. It has the ability to export to multiple image formats including BMP, EMF, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and WMF. With Aspose.BarCode for Java, developers have full control over every aspect of the barcode image including: background color, bar color, image quality, rotation angle, x-dimension, captions, customer-defined resolution, and more.

We are pleased to announce “Aspose.BarCode Java for Jython”, a new project for Jython developers. Project is aimed to provide useful examples for Jython developers who want to utilize “[Aspose.BarCode for Java][2]” in their Jython applications.
