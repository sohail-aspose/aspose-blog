[![][1]](http://www.aspose.com/java/project-management-component.aspx)We are pleased to share that Aspose.Tasks for Java 6.6.0 has been released with new features and fixes. Below, you'll find details of the most significant changes: rendering project data to 24 bpp RGB format and exporting a specific Gantt chart view.

For more information on what is new and fixed, you may visit the [product download page][2].

## Rendering Project Data to 24 bpp RGB Format

Ported from its .NET version, Aspose.Tasks for Java 6.6.0 provides the facility to configure the output image format to 24 bpp RGB while rendering project data. This also includes setting the horizontal and vertical resolution of the image. With this month’s release, Aspose.Tasks for .NET now allows rendering project data to 24 bits per pixel (bpp) RGB image formats.

## Exporting Specific Gantt Chart View

With our last month’s release, Aspose.Tasks introduced the feature of exporting Gantt chart view data for Microsoft Project 2003 and 2007 file formats. This month’s release further enhances this feature for Microsoft Project 2010 and 2013 file formats.
