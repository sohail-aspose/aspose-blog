As a support developer, many times, I want the customer to see only a single post not the complete thread. Because, either thread is too long or it has many mixed up discussions, which can potentially confuse the new customers. Many times, confusion creates more confusion.

So, what I do is, I right click the post id and copy the URL to notepad e.g

[http://www.aspose.com/community/forums/permalink/80171/80171/showthread.aspx#80171][1]

Then, I modify it like this

http://www.aspose.com/community/forums/post/80171.aspx

Now, this link will only show a single post and option to see the entire thread.

You can also make the above URL to look even better and user friendly. For example, you can add any text in it to explain to customer what the post is about. I usually add the title of the post.

[http://www.aspose.com/community/forums/post/80171/understanding-difference-placeholder-textholder-textframe.aspx][2]

But you can add anything. The only important thing for successful navigation by Aspose is the Post ID.
