Aspose.Flash for Reporting Services allows you to convert reporting services reports to SWF and FLV formats with great ease. In the latest version, we have enhanced the conversion performance to help improve the whole process. We have also worked on improving the quality of the output SWF and FLV files.  
  
You can see the complete list of changes and download the latest version from the [Aspose.Flash for Reporting Services download section][1].
