At Aspose we pride ourselves on the quality of our technical support; we put a huge amount of effort into our support operation to ensure that if our customers need our help they can get in contact with skilled staff members to ensure they can get a suitably appropriate and timely answer.  
   
As we have grown an increasing number of customers have expressed the need for “instant” support, these customers have needs that are usually attached to a deadline and require dedicated attention to help solve their problems when and if they occur. Our standard support model does not cater for these customers as well as we would like.  
  
To help accommodate these customers better we are introducing our new Priority Support option. This model of support builds on our excellent free support service but will give Priority users access to greater benefits including:  
  
• 12 Hour Guaranteed Response Time During Weekdays   
• Access to our private Priority Support forum  
• Issue escalation to product development teams  
• Hotfixes delivered to address your issues  
• Ability to prioritise feature requests

Our pricing model for Priority support is simple, for just $399 per year you can get access to this fantastic benefit on all your Aspose purchases on all subscription types.
