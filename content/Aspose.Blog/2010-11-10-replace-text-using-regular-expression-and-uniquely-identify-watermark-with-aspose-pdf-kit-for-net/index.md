Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET 5.0.0 is now available for download. In this latest release, we have added features to replace text based on regular expression and uniquely identify watermarks and then get their information or delete them. You can either replace the first occurrence of any string satisfying the regular expression or all the occurrences. This version also allows you to uniquely identify the stamps by their IDs; you can either get the information of these stamps or delete any or all of the stamps from a particular page. Please read the following two help topics to get the idea about these new features and see the code snippets as well:

Uniquely Identify and Delete Watermark

In addition to the above features, we have made some improvements and bug fixes in this version as well. Text replacement, getting document privileges, image extraction, PDF to image conversion, attachment extraction, deleting bookmarks and flattening form fields have been improved.

You can see the complete list of changes and download the latest version from the [Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET download section][1].
