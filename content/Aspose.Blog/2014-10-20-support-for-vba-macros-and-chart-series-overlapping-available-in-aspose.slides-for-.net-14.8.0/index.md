[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for .NET 14.8.0. This is a major product release where we have included support for some long awaited new features. We have also addressed certain rendering issues that have been reported in exported PDF, HTML and slide thumbnails in earlier product versions.

## New Features

The long awaited support for managing VBA macros inside presentations has been included in this release. Now you can add or access the existing VBA macros in a presentation using Aspose.Slides. To get started with this feature, please visit the documentation article Adding VBA Macros in Presentation.

We have also introduced support for overlapping chart series in this release. With this feature, it is possible to overlap the chart series over one another. For more details about this feature, please visit the documentation article Adding Chart Series Overlap for Charts.

We have also improved the shape thumbnail generation support by including a new enumerator that generates the shape thumbnail as per its appearance. Please visit the documentation article Generating a Shape Thumbnail in Bound of Shape's Appearance for further information about this feature.

Working with text has also been improved in this release. Now, if two consecutive text portions belonging to any text frame paragraph have same formatting, they will be merged into a single portion to avoid confusion about the number of portions in a paragraph.

## Resolved Issues

We have rectified issues that appeared when accessing, saving and rendering presentation to PDF, HTML or slide thumbnails, which resulted in different exceptions like NullReference, ArgumentException, IndexOutOfRange in previous releases.

We have also made a leap towards presentation rendering by rectifying many rendering issues inside exported PDF, HTML and slide thumbnails. Mainly, this product release has fixed issues to do with rendering chart entities, tables, text and bullets inside text frames. Details about the rendering issues can be found inside the release notes for Aspose.Slides for .NET 14.8.0 available in download section. Please visit the [download page to see the release notes for Aspose.Slides for .NET 14.8.0][2].

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please visit the documentation article Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for .NET 14.8.0 for further reference.
