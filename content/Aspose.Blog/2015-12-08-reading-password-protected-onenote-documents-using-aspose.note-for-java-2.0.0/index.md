We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Note for Java 2.0.0][2]. This month’s release includes a new feature and an enhancement. It also includes bug fixes that improve the overall functionality of the API. We have documented the public API changes included in this month’s release in our product documentation section for our users.

# New Features and Enhancements

**Reading Password Protected OneNote Documents:** Microsoft OneNote provides the option to password protect documents for securing personal information. Aspose.Note API now provides the support for reading such password protected OneNote documents. Its _LoadOptions_ class for loading documents provides _setDocumentPassword_ method to specify the document password.

**Creating Page Title in MS OneNote Style:** A standard page title in MS OneNote document is as shown in the following image. Aspose.Note API did not have the facility of creating such a page title until this release. This month’s release introduces new properties to the _TextStyle_ class that can be used to generate such a page title in MS OneNote document. These properties are:

*   _TextStyle.DefaultMsOneNoteTitleTextStyle_
*   _TextStyle.DefaultMsOneNoteTitleDateStyle_
*   _TextStyle.DeafultMsOneNoteTitleTimeStyle_

# Other Improvements

This month’s release also includes bug fixes related to various functional areas of the API. These include exceptions while loading certain OneNote documents as well as others found during internal product quality assurance. You can find details about what is new and fixed by visiting our [product download page][3].
