We have just released Aspose.Cells for .NET 4.8.1 hot fix.

Aspose.Cells for .NET provides some new enhancements for MS Excel 2007 file formats. For example, it now supports External workbook references of Excel 2007 xlsx files. It also supports Excel 2007 Themes and Colors that you may directly apply with ease. The formula calculation engine is optimized further; it also supports some new formulas. You can also set a picture as a background fill format for the chart.

There are some new enhancements for Aspose.Cells Grid controls too. The memory usage for different objects is optimized. There are a few valuable features in this regard: import/export xlsx files, apply styles to a range of cells, add Find/Replace feature for the desktop grid and auto-fit rows/columns using APIsÂ etc.

There are some other fixes and enhancements too, see the download page:
