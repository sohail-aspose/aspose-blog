[![Aspose.Diagram for Java logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/aspose_diagram-for-java.png)We are pleased to announce that the [new version 17.4.0 of Aspose.Diagram for Java API][2] is now live. The new version of the API has improved the feature of importing a Bitmap image as a shape in Visio drawing. Developers can also find improvements in routing and building the structure of connectors with a high accuracy rate. All the regular bug fixes are also included. We recommend our clients [use the powerful Aspose for Java APIs directly in their Maven Projects with simple configurations][3]. For details on API fixes, please visit the product Release Notes section of this new version.

## Import of a Bitmap Image as a new Visio ShapeAspose.Diagram for Java API has already added support of importing graphics in the Visio drawing. Developers may then [export the Visio drawing to any supported format][4]. The new API version 17.4.0 has enhanced the import of Bitmap image internally without any API change. Developers can now import a Bitmap image even in their complex drawings. This help topic narrates how to import a Bitmap image in the Visio drawing as a new shape: Import Bitmap Image as a Visio Shape  
  
Aspose.Diagram for Java API has also made improvements in routing mechanism to address the connections of Visio shapes as well as auto routing of connectors. This helps developers to track the flow of nodes because the clarity is important in drawings. Please check a list of the resolved defects:  

*   Fixed: The connecting lines are not connected while creating a VDX.
    
*   Fixed: Missing shapes on converting a VDX to VSDM.
    
*   Fixed: The text items are rendered vertically on converting a VDX to VSDM.
    
*   Fixed: Connectors are not in the right positions with changing the page layout in VSDX.
    

We auto port Aspose.Diagram for .NET to Java to give developers perfectly the same features on both platforms, so this version also incorporates the bug fixes and enhancements from its equivalent .NET version.
