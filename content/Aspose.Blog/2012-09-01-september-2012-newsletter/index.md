Welcome to the September 2012 edition of the Saaspose Newsletter. This newsletter highlights the information about latest updates in APIs, exciting new features and the informative blogs. Keep your fingers crossed for the useful tip revealed in "Tip of the Month" section.![](https://blog.aspose.com/)

![](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/06/tip.png)**Tip of the Month: Invitation to Get Involved In Beta Release of Heroku Add-On** We're very much excited to share a good news with Heroku lovers! As Saaspose is a platform and language independent REST API, we want to make sure that we provide examples, SDKs, add-ons, and plug-ins for your favorite language and platform. Our team has been working to integrate our REST API with Heroku and creating Heroku add-on to get you started with this platform. We have created different examples for [Java][1], [Ruby][2] and [Python][3] for now. You can also download the source code of these examples from Github:

*   Heroku Examples for Ruby
*   Heroku Examples for Java
*   Heroku Examples for Python

Our team has put a great deal of effort into bringing this add-on up quickly along with simple getting started documentation and examples etc. Now, we welcome all of you to be part of it during the beta stage. As you understand, we'll have to invite interested users to be part of this beta release. So, if you want to get involved and peek into our Heroku add-on before it goes public, please send us an email at support@saaspose.com with the title 'Invitation for Heroku Add-On', and we'll send you an invitation. ![](https://blog.aspose.com/)
