 [![Aspose.BarCode for JasperReports][1]](https://products.aspose.com/barcode/jasperreports) We are pleased to announce new Aspose.BarCode for JasperReports 18.6 release.

This release has been developed based on Aspose.BarCode for Java 18.6, whereby we have fixed the issues in the API. It was reported that Aspose.BarCode is not recognizing the QR barcode successfully from TIFF images. After investigation this issue has been resolved. Now API recognizes the QR barcode from TIFF images properly.
