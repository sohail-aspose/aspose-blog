If you are looking for Aspose.iCalendar on our website then you might be confused because we have removed Aspose.iCalendar from products, purchase, downloads, demos, forums, blogs and documentation sections of our website.

We did this because Aspose.iCalendar is integrated into Aspose.Network since the release of _Aspose.Network for .NET v4.3.0.0_ on 20th November, 2008.
