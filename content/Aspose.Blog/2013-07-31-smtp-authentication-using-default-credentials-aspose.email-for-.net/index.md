We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Email for .NET][1] 3.2.0. This month’s release includes a number of bug fixes, enhancements and new features.

This month’s release provides an enhancement of SMTP authentication using DefaultCredentials for Exchange users. This enables a logged on user to send emails without providing a username and password if they are logged on to a Windows domain. This is beneficial where one doesn’t want to include the username/password in an applications for security or other reasons.

This month’s release also provides a feature for testing the IMAP connection state while the application is running. The ImapClient's ConnectionState property tells the current state whether it is open, connected, broken, closed, etc.

We have also added the ability to calculate the N next occurrences of a recurrence pattern. In addition, user-friendly text for a recurrence can be obtained now using the newly introduced FriendlyText property of the RecurrenceRule.

This month’s release also fixes a number of bugs related to EWS, message decryption and signature management, retrieval of date information, issues related to messages with Arabic and Hebrew characters, messages to TIFF and XPS issues, and some PST to EML conversion issues.

To get further details about what’s new & fixed, read the release notes on the [Aspose.Email for .NET][2] release page.
