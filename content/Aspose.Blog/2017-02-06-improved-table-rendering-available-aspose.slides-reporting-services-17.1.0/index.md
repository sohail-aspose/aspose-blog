We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 17.1.0.

This is one of maintainance releases where we have improved the table rendering support by fixing issues related to tables rendering. We have also addressed the issues related to export of report to presentation that earlier resulted in different exceptions.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 17.1.0 Release Notes][1] for further reference.
