Aspose Team is pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Cells for C++ 17.3.0][1]. The new version of the API has improved the export quality of XLSX files to any supported format. Developers can integrate a feature to read the Excel (XLS, XLSX, XLSM, XLSB), CSV or Tab Delimited files, and then transform in the Excel97To2003 and XLSX formats. We are gradually integrating many other key features. Please take a look over the release notes to get an idea about what is new and what has been enhanced with this revision of Aspose.Cells for C++ API. If you are planning to upgrade the API from an old version, we recommend checking the [Public API Changes][2] section to know what has been changed since this new version.
