## Celebrating 10,000 customers

We are rapidly reaching 10,000 customers, a milestone that we want to celebrate. We're giving away a MacBook Air as well as a Developer Small Business license to the 10,000th customer. To give everyone a chance to celebrate with us, we're offering a 25% discount on Aspose.Total.

In September, we're changing the name of Aspose.Network to Aspose.Email. We're making the change to better reflect the focus of the product and what our customers use it for. It is only the name we're changing: the features stay the same.

Like what we do? You can vote for our products in the DevProConnections Community Choice Awards until September 7th.

Many thanks,  
Danny Cooper, Aspose Texas Team Leader
