We are more than happy to announce the release of Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services 2.4.0. This version provides great support for Tablix controls and rendering them in PDF documents. In this release, we have also improved how tables and nested tables are rendered and added support for RowSpan and ColsSpan attributes for table object. We've improved the alignment of report elements. Lastly, you can now use Unicode characters to represent bullets as well as simple alphabetical or numerical values.
