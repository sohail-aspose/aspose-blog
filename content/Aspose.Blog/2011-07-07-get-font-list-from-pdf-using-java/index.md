We have released [Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java][1] 3.9.0. In this version, we have introduced a new feature to get a list of all the fonts available in the PDF file. TheÂ PdfExtractor class now supports this feature. You may find a working example in the following help topic: Get List of the Fonts from the PDF File. We have also improved the features related to PDF to JPEG and TIFF conversion, form filling, fonts, and text rendering.

You may download the latest version from the [Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java][2] downloads section.
