[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-Java_100.png) We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Java 8.5.0. This is a maintenance release that focuses on rectifying text rendering and chart support issues.

## Fixes and Improvements

We have resolved several text rendering issues in this release, including bullet rendering, improper text strike out and wrong text color rendering for generated PDF and thumbnails. We have resolved improper chart rendering issues as well in this release, including issues with the wrong chart area color, missing markers, missing high-low lines and wrong chart type getting rendered in exported PDFs.

Apart from rendering issues, we have also made improvement to presentation access and saving issues for some presentation decks that failed to get accessed or saved in older version of Aspose.Slides for Java.
