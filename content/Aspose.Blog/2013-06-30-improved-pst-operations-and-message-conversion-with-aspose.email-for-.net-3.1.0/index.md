In our continuous efforts to improve the performance and functionality of the Aspose.Email library, we have fixed a number of issues related to different functionality areas of the API. This month's release is sort of a maintenance release where a number of bugs reported by our users have been fixed in addition to our ongoing quality assurance efforts. These include, but are not limited to:

*   Encoding issues during message conversions.
*   Message headers formatting as per defined RFCs.
*   Extraction of messages from PST to EML and MSG.
*   Issues related to setting and retrieving information from Appointment objects.
*   Exceptions raised when saving Appointments.

To get further details about what's new & fixed, read the release notes on the [Aspose.Email for .NET][2] release page.
