DWG files are used to save digital drawings in the 2D or 3D format, while DXF is the Drawing Exchange Format which is used for compatibility of AutoCAD data with other applications. You can convert [DWG][1] or [DXF][2] to raster image formats like [JPG][3], [PNG][4], [GIF][5], etc. as per your requirements. In this article, you will be learning the CAD file formats conversion to raster images programmatically using Java. Please refer to the following sections for further details:
