A watermark identifies the state of the document with texts like confidential, draft, etc., and makes it difficult for the original document to be copied. Watermarks are also used to specify the ownership of a document by showing the company name or logo. Watermarks in PowerPoint files can be both image or text-based. In this article, you will learn **how to add text and image watermarks to PowerPoint slides using C++**.

## C++ API for Adding Watermark to PowerPoint Slides {#CPP-API-for-Adding-Watermark-to-PowerPoint-Slides}

We will use the [Aspose.Slides for C++][6] API to add watermark to PowerPoint slides. It is a robust and feature-rich API that supports creating, reading, and updating PowerPoint files without requiring additional software. You can either install the API through [NuGet][7] or download it directly from the [Downloads][8] section.

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.Slides.Cpp
```

## Add Text Watermark to PowerPoint Slides using C++ {#Add-Text-Watermark-to-PowerPoint-Slides-using-CPP}

You can add a text watermark to PowerPoint slides by following the steps given below.

*   Firstly, load the PowerPoint file using the [Presentation][9] class.
*   Retrieve the master slide.
*   Calculate the position of the watermark.
*   Add a shape using the [IMasterSlide->get\_Shapes()->AddAutoShape(ShapeType shapeType, float x, float y, float width, float height)][10] method.
*   Add text frame to the shape using the [IAutoShape->AddTextFrame(System::String text)][11] method.
*   Set the font size, color, and rotation angle of the watermark.
*   Lock the watermark so that it cannot be moved or removed.
*   Finally, save the PowerPoint file using the [Presentation->Save(System::String fname, Export::SaveFormat format)][12] method.

The following sample code shows how to add text watermark to PowerPoint slides using C++.

## Add Image Watermark to PowerPoint Slides using C++ {#Add-Image-Watermark-to-PowerPoint-Slides-using-CPP}

In order to add an image watermark to PowerPoint slides, please follow the steps given below.

*   Firstly, load the PowerPoint file using the [Presentation][13] class.
*   Retrieve the master slide.
*   Calculate the position of the watermark.
*   Add a shape using the [IMasterSlide->get\_Shapes()->AddAutoShape(ShapeType shapeType, float x, float y, float width, float height)][14] method.
*   Add the image and get its reference in an [IPPImage][15] object.
*   Set the watermark image using the [IAutoShape->get\_FillFormat()->get\_PictureFillFormat()->get\_Picture()->set\_Image(System::SharedPtr<IPPImage> value)][16] method.
*   Set the fill type and picture fill mode of the [IAutoShape][17] to [FillType::Picture][18] and [PictureFillMode::Stretch][19], respectively.
*   Lock the watermark so that it cannot be moved or removed.
*   Finally, save the PowerPoint file using the [Presentation->Save(System::String fname, Export::SaveFormat format)][20] method.

The following sample code shows how to add an image watermark to PowerPoint slides using C++.
