You can add different controls like textbox, checkbox and combobox etc. to your worksheets using Aspose.Cells API.

We create a demo video for the users. In this video, we create a simple Windows application to exercise how user can add different controls (Textbox, Checkbox and Combobox) to the worksheet.
