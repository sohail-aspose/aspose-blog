[![Aspose.Imaging for SharePoint logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/10/aspsoe_imaging-for-sharepoint.jpg)Aspose.Imaging is a flexible image processing set of components that lets developers create, edit, draw and convert images in their applications with ease and performance. Aspose.Imaging provides features that go beyond the native capabilities of the platform they work on and works independently of other applications. Moreover a set of pens, brushes and fonts can be used to draw images or add new elements & text to existing images. Currently, Aspose.Imaging is available for popular platforms like .NET, Java and Cloud.

Aspose development team is excited to announce the addition of another product to its Aspose.Imaging family: Aspose.Imaging for SharePoint. Aspose.Imaging for SharePoint allows SharePoint users to export images to supported image formats (PNG, JPG, BMP, GIF, TIFF and PSD), resize, crop, and rotate and flip images.

## Working with Aspose.Imaging for SharePoint

To get started, follow the Aspose.Imaging for SharePoint user guide for details and available options. For instance, it shows how easy it is to export an image to other supported image formats (PNG, JPG, BMP, GIF, TIFF and PSD) with reliability and high performance. Aspose.Imaging for SharePoint component adds a **Convert Image** option to the **ECB** menu to let you export images. The following steps are required to complete the task:

1.  Select an image file from document library and select **Convert Image** from the **ECB** menu.[![][2]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/10/Convert_Image-e1384250983358.png)

## Easy Installation

Many of our users have reported how difficult other applications can be to install on SharePoint. They often have to install plug-ins or extensions more than once and then spent time on configuration before it works as expected. The Aspose team has spent a lot of time to make sure that our SharePoint extensions don’t have any such problems. Instead, our installations are fast and work as expected. SharePoint applications are complex enough without us adding complications.

That is at the core of our development philosophy: to make file format tools that make other developers’ lives easier.
