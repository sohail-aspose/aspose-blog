**USA, Texas – January 1, 2011** – Documents - letters, emails, spreadsheets, plans, models, presentations and movies - help companies do their business. Documents hold the stored knowledge of an organisation, building bridges from colleagues in time and space. To help you make the most of the documents that you company rely on, Aspose create components that let software engineers quickly convert, create and manipulate documents in most of the popular file formats from within their own applications.

Perpetuum Software develops high-quality components and software that give businesses real advantages. They develop tools that help software engineers build complex business intelligence applications quickly. Focussing on visualisation and reporting, they offer development tools for .NET, OLAP and Silverlight.

Aspose and Perpetuum Software have similar cultures and the technologies they work with are complementary. A partnership between the two is a natural step.

Danny Cooper, Team Leader for Aspose Texas, says "_Perpetuum and Aspose tools allow developers to extend SQL Reporting Services in very essential ways: viewing and export diversity. It seemed only natural to create a partnership which brings our offerings together, along with additional savings for our customers_."

Irina Tulinova, Business Development Manager at Perpetuum Software, says "_Exporting quality reports to various formats is essential for any rich Internet application. Support for Aspose Rendering Extensions in our Silverlight Viewer for Reporting Services is a vital enhancement for our customers who need to meet the high standards of RIA_".
