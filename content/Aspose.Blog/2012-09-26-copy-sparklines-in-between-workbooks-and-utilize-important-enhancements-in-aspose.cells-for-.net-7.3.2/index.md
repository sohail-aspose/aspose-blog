[![Aspose.Cells logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/05/aspose.cells-logo2.jpg)We proudly to announce the release of Aspose.Cells for .NET 7.3.2. In this release we have added support for copying [sparklines][2] between workbooks. We have also made an important enhancement to how protected ranges in the worksheet are handled: users can now set permissions for domain users/groups. Moreover, several important customer issues have been rectified. Many important issues with reading and writing Microsoft Excel files, manipulating charts, the Page Setup module and PDF export have been resolved in this release. Issues pertaining to Smart Markers and formula calculations have also been addressed. We have also made enhancements and improved performance to how PivotTables are rendered.
