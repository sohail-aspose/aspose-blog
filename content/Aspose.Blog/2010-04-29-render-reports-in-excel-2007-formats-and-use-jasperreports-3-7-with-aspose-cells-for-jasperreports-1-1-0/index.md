We have published Aspose.Cells for JasperReports v1.1.0 for the users.  
  
In this version, we have supported Microsoft Excel 97 to 2003 and Microsoft Excel 2007 formats. More details can be found at the document Configuration Parameters in the product documentation. We have also fixed several issues of calculation in report element size. Moreover, the component, now, supports JasperReports 3.7.  
  
There are some other fixes and enhancements too.
