[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We proudly present the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for .NET 8.2.0. This is one of major releases whereby we have introduced some new features and have fixed some of major issues incurring in the earlier versions.

We have enhanced the support for SmartArt loading, saving, editing, and 2d-rendering of objects. The improved support for setting the SmartArt background color and SmartArt text rendering has been included in this release.

We have introduced the support for setting multilevel chart categories in this release. Now, one can add the child nodes for any chart category. Please visit this documentation link for further information about the feature support. We have also introduced the support for setting the zoom level of the generated presentation when it is PowerPoint. Earlier, Aspose.Slides generated use to in default 100% zoom level. The support for automatic update of linked ole frame data has also been introduced in this version. With this feature in service now, the any change in the linked ole frame file will also get reflected in generated presentation as well.

For your convenience, we have also added the sample dashboard application as well along with product release that fetch the programmer guide examples from Github, so that you can instantly try using the programmer guide samples on your end.

Several presentation rendering issues inside exported PDF and slides thumbnails including missing hyperlinks, missing images, wrong font substitution and improper text rendering have been resolved in this new release. The support for PPT to PPTX conversion has also been improved to a great extent by resolving the text coloring and lost hyperlinks issues. The presentation access, saving and exporting to PDF issues have also been rectified in this release.
