![Aspose.Slides icon][1]

We like to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for JasperReports 1.9.0.

This is primarily a maintenance release that has been developed on the basis of the latest available version of Aspose.Slides for Java, 7.3.0. This new release has no more dependency upon legacy JAI libraries for  rendering presentations. We have also resolved issues related to access the license when using Aspose.Slides for JasperReports as well.

To see a complete list of fixes and to download Aspose.Slides for Jasper Reports 1.9.0, please visit the [download page][2].
