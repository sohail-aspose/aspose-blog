Many of our customers have been using Aspose.Pdf for Android to create native Android applications which provide the capabilities to create as well as manipulate existing PDF documents. Since Aspose.Pdf for Android is subset of Aspose.Pdf for Java and contains most of the important features, so in order to streamline the naming conventions, we are changing its name from Aspose.Pdf for Android to Aspose.Pdf for Android via Java. Nevertheless, like every new release, we are always striving to introduce a more robust, stable and feature rich release version and we will continue to offer new releases with greater improvements.

## Important consideration

Please note that the API structure still remains the same and we do not intend to make any changes at structure level and this change it will not disturb your existing code. Currently we have changed the API name on [Aspose.Pdf for Android via Java][1] product page and similar changes are also reflected on [Aspose.Pdf product family pages][2]. We have also renamed Aspose.Pdf for Android documentation wiki space to Aspose.Pdf for Android via Java wiki but in near future, we will be using one common JAVA Documentation both for Aspose.Pdf for Java and Aspose.Pdf for Android via Java and soon we will revamp the documentation section. Nevertheless, in order to cope with all this change, we have also renamed Aspose.Pdf for Android node to Aspose.Pdf for Android via Java in Downloads section. Please stay tuned for further updates.
