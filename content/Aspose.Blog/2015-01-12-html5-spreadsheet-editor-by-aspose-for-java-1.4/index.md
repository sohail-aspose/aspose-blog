# What’s new?

Every new release is more powerful and stable compared to the previous one. Let’s highlight some prominent features here:

### User Interface

1.4 comes with a new user interface that is better organized, more accessible and easy to remember. All features are represented by buttons and lists on a flat panel grouped in tabs.

### Look and Feel

A good interface must have a better look for a great feel. The new version has better typography, colors, layout and element alignment, which double the user confidence to use and depend on it.

### Opening files

The new interface has changed the previously used method of opening files from the **local computer** and **Dropbox**. Both options are now available as buttons on **File tab** instead of menus. Learn more about opening files [local computer][1] and [dropbox][2].

### Export and Save file

The Editor now allows users to export the spreadsheet to [various file formats][3].

### Selecting and Editing Cell

Selecting a cell and editing it is more user-friendly in 1.4. Learn more about cell [selection and editing][4].

### Working with Sheets

The drop-down list of sheets in the top right corner has been moved into the **_Sheets tab_**. The user can [**add**][5], [**remove**][6], [**rename**][7], and **[switch to another sheet][8]**.

### Working with Rows and Columns

1.4 provides buttons on **_Format tab_** to manipulate rows and columns. The user can:

*   [Add a row][9] above and below the selected cell.
*   [Add a column][10] on the right and left of the selected cell.
*   [Delete the row][11] including the selected cell.
*   [Delete the column][12] including the selected cell.

### Faster and optimized

HTML5 Spreadsheet Editor has been optimized internally for performance and reliability. Special care has been taken to minimize the frequency and amount of data transferred between the web browser and server.
