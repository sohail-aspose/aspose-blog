[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We like to share the announcement of new release of Aspose.Slides for .NET. This is a maintenance release where several presentation rendering issues have been addressed. We have now improved the HTML import support in Aspose.Slides text frames and have provided support for tables tags, text formatting tags and many other embedded CSS properties tags.

We have resolved many chart, table and text rendering, as well as export to PDF issues in this new release. Many slide cloning and table manipulation issues have also been rectified. We have also enhanced the performance of Aspose.Slides when managing the presentation tables in this release.
