Aspose has donated a few copies of our components to two .NET events that are taking place in the next few weeks. We are excited to be able to help sponsor these great .NET events.

The first event is the .**NET Code Camp in** **Harrisburg,** **PA**. It will be held on **December 6th, 2008** at Harrisburg University of Science and Technology. This is free registration with free parking. http://centralpenn.web121.discountasp.net/home/

It will be held on **December 13th, 2008** at Center for the Application of Information Technology (CAIT) at Washington University in St. Louis, located on the West Campus near Hanley and Forsyth.
