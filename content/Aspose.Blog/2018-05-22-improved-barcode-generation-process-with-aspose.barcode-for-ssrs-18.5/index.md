We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.BarCode for Reporting Services 18.5.  
  
This release has been developed based on Aspose.BarCode for .NET 18.5. In this release barcode generation process have been improved. It was reported that **GetCustomSizeBarCodeImage** method is not working properly. It is discarding the check digit in the resultant image of barcode. After investigation this issue has been resolved by improving the internal barcode drawing functionality. This improved version supports better rendering of SQL Server reports having barcodes.
