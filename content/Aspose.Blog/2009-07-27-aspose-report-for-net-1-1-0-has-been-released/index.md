Aspose.Report for .NET 1.1.0 has been released. This release supports creation of complex Bar charts by providing multiple Y values against a single X value. This release also enables users to restrict the DataPoint labels within a specific height and width in Pie and Doughnut charts to avoid the reduction in circle or donut size.

The Aspose.Report for .NET 1.1.0 installer includes a separate build for .NET 3.5 and this release also includes some important fixes from previous version.
