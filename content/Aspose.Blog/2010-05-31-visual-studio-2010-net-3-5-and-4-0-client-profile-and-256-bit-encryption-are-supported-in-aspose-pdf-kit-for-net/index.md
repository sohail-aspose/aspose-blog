We have published Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET 4.5.0. In this latest version, we have provided support for Visual Studio 2010. Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.0 [Client Profile][1] is supported in this version. The latest installer contains the DLLs for .NET 1.1, 2.0, 3.5, 3.5 Client Profile, 4.0 and 4.0 Client Profile in separate folders.  
  
This version of Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET also supports 256 bit encryption. There are three key sizes (X40, X128, and X256) available in the form of KeySize enumeration, which can be used to encrypt a PDF file. Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET also supports two algorithms (RC4 and AES) in the form of Algorithm enumeration. X40 key size can use RC4 algorithm, while X256 can use AES algorithm, however X128 can use any of the RC4 and AES algorithms.  
  
In addition to the above new features, we have also improved Form, PdfViewer, PdfContentEditor, PdfFileEditor classes. In this latest version, we have enhanced concatenation, printing PDF files with barcode, PDF to image conversion and decoding the PDF pages features.
