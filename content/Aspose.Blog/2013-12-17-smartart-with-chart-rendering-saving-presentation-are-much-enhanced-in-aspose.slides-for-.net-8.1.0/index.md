[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We proudly present the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for .NET 8.1.0. This is mainly a maintenance release whereby we have made some significant improvements towards SmartArt and chart rendering support. The preservation of charts entities and SmartArt shapes inside generated thumbnails and PDF files have also been ensured in this release.

Issues pertaining to slide transition and animation effects in saved presentations have also been resolved in this release. We have also rectified the inconsistencies when saving presentations with OLE frames that earlier resulted in corrupted presentations. Issues pertaining to an exception being thrown when accessing or saving presentations have also been addressed in this release.
