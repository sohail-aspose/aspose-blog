We like to share the release announcement for [Aspose.Slides for .NET][1] 14.6.0. This is one of major product release in which we have included some new features and have stabilized many existing ones.

## New Features

We have introduced support for cloning or copying shapes within presentation slides with this release. Now, it is possible to replicate the shapes from a source slide by adding or inserting them into the target slide shape collection. For more details about shape cloning, please visit the documentation article [Cloning Shapes in Slides][2].

Now, it is also possible to set the presentation view type for when a presentation is opened in Microsoft PowerPoint. For more details about how to use this feature, please visit the documentation article Save Presentation with Predefined View Type.

We have also made improvements to the chart section. Now, you can add error bars for MSO charts using Aspose.Slides. Please visit the documentation article, [Adding Error Bars for Charts][3], for further information.

## Resolved Issues

We have improved the chart rendering support and have resolved issues including missing charts, missing chart labels, improperly rendered chart axis and missing chart bars issues in exported PDF and slide thumbnails. We have also resolved issues related to presentation access, saving and exporting to PDF that earlier resulted in exceptions when using older product version.

We have also made some good improvement to SmartArt rendering and resolved issues pertaining to improper rendering of SmartArt shapes. The issues related to improperly rendered text and missing hyperlinks in exported PDF and images have also been rectified.

We have enhanced chart support in this release and have resolved issues related to setting the chart category direction, formatting chart labels, setting font-related properties for different chart entities and radar chart support.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please visit the documentation article [Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for .NET 14.6.0][4] for further reference.
