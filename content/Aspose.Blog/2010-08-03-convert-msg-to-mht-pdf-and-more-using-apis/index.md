[EMCrypt][1] is a plug-in for Microsoft Outlook, designed to effectively and easily encrypt and then convert Outlook emails to PDF format. It supports all versions from 2003 to 2010, and is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7.

With EMCrypt, the email, along with any attachments, is converted to PDF, encrypted, and can then be opened by the recipient using a PDF reader and the password. Appearance and functions can be adjusted to suit individual tastes

## Requirements Scenario

The most important requirements are outlined below.

*   100% .NET compliant and .NET native (including .NET 3.5)
*   Single library for 32-bt and 64-bit deployment
*   Simple installation and distribution
*   [Royalty-free distribution license][2]
*   Excellent support including [searchable online forums][3], online samples, and [online documentation][4]
*   Product stability
*   No requirement to install Microsoft Office applications on the server
*   No requirement to create special system services for PDF transformation

### **PDF functionality:**

*   Ability to [convert .DOC, .DOCX, .PPT, .PPTX, .XLS, .XLSX into PDF][5]
*   Ability to convert text and [images into PDF][6]
*   Ability to [merge PDFs][7]
*   Ability to [read and write PDF form fields][8]

### **Reporting functionality:**

*   Ability to [generate Microsoft Excel reports][9]
*   Ability to [generate CSV reports][10]

### **Import functionality:**

*   Ability to [import from Microsoft Excel documents][11]
*   Ability to [import from PDF forms][12]

The [Aspose components][13] met or exceeded all of our requirements.

## Solution Implementation

In order to [convert the Outlook MSG format to PDF][14], we have used [Aspose.Email for .NET][15] to [convert the MSG file to MHT][16], and then with [Aspose.Words for .NET][17], we have [converted the MHT file to PDF][18].

After the conversion was completed, we used [Aspose.PDF for .NET][19] to [add the attachments to the PDF][20] and [encrypt the resulting PDF][21], again using [Aspose.PDF for .NET][22].

## Benefits Gained by Switching to Aspose

[Aspose.Total for .NET][23] was simple to implement programmatically, rich in functionality, and flexible enough to tweak for specific requirement scenarios. Most importantly to the development team, it provided a way for content owners to manage their own content ongoing.

> _Editors note, January 2014: Since this case study was published, some of Aspose tools have changed. Aspose.Network is now [Aspose.Email][24]. Meanwhile, Aspose.Pdf.Kit, mentioned in the next paragraph, has been integrated into [Aspose.PDF][25] to create a flexible component for creating and manipulating PDF files._

## Future Implementations

Future opportunities are ample with [Aspose.PDF for .NET][26]. We actually got [Aspose.Total for .NET][27], and by combining [Aspose.PDF for .NET][28] with some of the other modules, we can [generate Microsoft Word documents][29], [create and auto-populate spreadsheets][30], turn spreadsheets and [documents into PDFs][31], [combine multiple PDFs into a single one][32] (_very important for a host of documents required for capturing applicant project plans, maps, and other documentation_), and even the possibility of using the [Aspose.BarCode for .NET][33] module to develop mobile applications to allow game wardens to tag evidence in the field for chain-of-custody tracking.

## Conclusion

We are extremely satisfied and excited about [Aspose.PDF for .NET][34], plus the rest of the [Aspose.Total for .NET][35] suite of products. The benefits afforded and development labor saved, made its cost-benefit return very high. We look forward to using it in many other applications.
