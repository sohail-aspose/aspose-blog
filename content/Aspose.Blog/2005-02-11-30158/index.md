Dear customers,  

This week you may experience some slow or [no replies from some of our developers][1] simply because some of our developers are living in China and they are having their [Chinese New Year][2] holiday. It's a big holiday like Christmas so normally it lasts about one week or more.  

Aspose is well known for rapid response in the .NET component industry. If you have realized this week is just an exception due to [Chinese New Year][3] holiday, I truly appreciate you very much. Anyway, all your un-answered questions hopefully be attended during this weekend or early next week.  

Please note [Chinese New Year][4] holiday just affects technical support of some components. As [our teams are from world wide][5], all purchasing/licensing/sales supports as well as technical support of some other components are normal as in the before.  

Thanks again for your patience and understanding.  

And I wish all Chinese developers:
