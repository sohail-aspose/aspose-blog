## PDF Attachment Manipulation API - Free Download {#PDF-Attachment-Manipulation-API}

[Aspose.PDF for .NET][7] is a well-known PDF manipulation API that lets you process PDF files seamlessly. You can read, create, edit, and convert the PDF files and manipulate the PDF attachments within a few steps. The API can be [downloaded][8] as DLL or MSI as well as installed using [NuGet][9].

```
Install-Package Aspose.Pdf
```

## Add Attachments to PDF using C# {#Add-Attachments-to-PDF-using-CSharp}

Aspose.PDF for .NET also allows you to add the attachments to a PDF file. For this, you simply need to add the file to [Document.EmbeddedFiles][10] collection using the [FileSpecification][11] class. The following are the steps to add an attachment to a PDF document.

*   Create a new PDF document using [Document][12] class.
*   Create an instance of [FileSpecification][13] class to load the attachment file.
*   Use [Document.EmbeddedFiles.Add(FileSpecification)][14] method to add the attachment.
*   Save the document using [Document.Save(String)][15] method.

The following code sample shows how to add an attachment to a PDF document using C#.

## Extract PDF Attachment using C# {#Extract-PDF-Attachment-using-CSharp}

First of all, let's check out how to retrieve attachments from a PDF document. For this, follow the below steps:

*   Create an instance of the [Document][16] class.
*   Get the attachments into an [EmbeddedFileCollection][17] object using [Document.EmbeddedFiles][18] property.
*   Loop through attachments in the [EmbeddedFileCollection][19] using [FileSpecification][20] object.
*   Access properties of each attachment using [FileSpecification][21] object.
*   Save the attachment as a file (if required).

The following code sample shows how to extract PDF attachments using C#.

## Remove Attachments from PDF using C# {#Remove-Attachments-from-PDF-using-CSharp}

You can either remove all or a particular attachment from a PDF file. For this, Aspose.PDF for .NET provides the following methods:

*   [Delete()][22] - Deletes all the attachments.
*   [Delete(String fileName)][23] - Deletes attachment by name.
*   [DeleteByKey(String Key)][24] - Deletes attachment by key in the collection.

The following are the steps to delete attachments from a PDF.

*   Create an instance of the [Document][25] class to load the PDF file.
*   Use [Document.EmbeddedFiles.Delete()][26] (or other delete method) to delete attachments.
*   Save the file using [Document.Save(String)][27] method.

The following code sample shows how to remove attachments from a PDF file in C#.
