This is a minor release containing a fix for theÂ MSI installer.

**What's fixed:**

*   MSI installer requires .NET Framework 1.1 to run.

Now the installer supports any version of .NET Framework installed on the target machine.

Apart of this fix, the release includes minor memory optimizations and code refactorings that do not affect the functionality of the product.
