The last version of Aspose.Imaging for Java was ported from Aspose.Imaging for .NET 1.4.0. As the current release is ported from Aspose.Imaging for .NET 1.7.0 it includes all the features and functionality introduced in Aspose.Imaging for .NET 1.5.0, 1.6.0 and 1.7.0. Exporting TIFF image with compression algorithms - for example CCITT4 and CCITT3 - PSD layer manipulation, rotate and flip image are a few of those new features.
