## Giving Developers a Streamlined Experience

Technology never stands still. That's true for Aspose's products as well as the various products and platforms that we work with. Last year, Microsoft released major updates to the Microsoft Office product suite, SQL Server Reporting Services platform and Visual Studio. Aspose's products have been tested with all three. We have a couple of updates to make before we fully support all of the format and feature changes that Microsoft Office 2013 introduced but are mostly there. We fully [support Visual Studio 2012][1] so our .NET and Reporting Services users can continue using our tools with their favorite IDE. Most of our SSRS products have been successfully tested on Reporting Services 2012: we're currently testing Aspose.BarCode for SSRS.

Thank you for reading,
