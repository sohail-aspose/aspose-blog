We're pleased to announce that the [new version 17.1.0 of Aspose.Diagram for .NET API][1] is now live. The new version of the API allows developers to export the Visio drawing with selective shapes into any other supported format. We’re constantly improving Aspose.Diagram API for better performance and quality. Recently, we have improved the export quality of Visio drawings. The recent version also covers a number of regular bug fixes and enhancements. Developers can install an Aspose.Diagram Nuget package in their .NET applications because we publish each version as [a NuGet package on the NuGet gallery][2]. We recommend our clients upgrade old version of Aspose.Diagram API to this latest one. For details on API fixes, please check Release Notes having a complete list of the features, enhancements and bug fixes.

## Save Selective Visio Shapes into any of Supported Formats

Using Aspose.Diagram API, developers can already convert Visio drawings to other supported formats. All these formats are listed here: Save Visio Diagram. Using the latest version 17.1.0 or higher, developers can now select specific shapes, and then save the Visio drawing into any other supported format. The output drawing keeps only the selected shapes, since this feature adds more control over the way of exporting Visio drawings. This help topic shows how to export a Visio drawing with selective shapes: Convert Visio Drawing with Selective Shapes.

This version also incorporates the fixes of injecting additional shapes in the Visio drawing, partial rendering of shapes, duplicate hyperlinks, and the general formatting problems of the diagram. These enhancements and bug fixes improve the performance and accuracy of Aspose.Diagram API. Please check a list of the resolved defects:

*   Fixed: VSD to PDF conversion, incorrect date format in the title shape.
