Many users told us that they liked new features provided by Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services. In the mean time, they also wanted to port their existing RDL reports smoothly.

In this new version, we enhanced standard RDL support. Now our product not only can render RDL reports as built-in Excel render, but also support some more RDL elments, for example, nest tables.

And with this new version, develpers can integrate Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services with Report Viewer control in local mode.

Please download and try v1.3.0.0 at [http://www.aspose.com/community/files/52/ssrs-rendering-extensions/aspose.cells.reporting.services/category1189.aspx][1] .
