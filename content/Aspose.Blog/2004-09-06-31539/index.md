I am thinking of making a new product: Aspose.Cells.Express. The product will utilize SmartMarker technique and will be an Express product of Aspose.Cells.

Only ExcelDesigner object in Aspose.Cells will be exposed. Users can use this product to import an Excel file with smart markers. Then call the Process method to populate the data.

Using the designer file with smart markers and a few lines of code, users can create a very complex excel file.

Of course this product will not offer all features of Aspose.Cells, but it will be easier to use with a rich set of features.
