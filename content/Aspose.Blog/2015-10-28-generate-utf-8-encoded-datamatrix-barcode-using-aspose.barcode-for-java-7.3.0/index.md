We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.BarCode for Java 7.3.0. This release supports generating DataMatrix Barcode that is UTF-8 encoded.

## Create UTF-8 Encoded Datamatrix Barcode in Java

DataMatrix is used to encode product and serial number information on electrical rating plates, to identify lenses, circuit boards, and other items during manufacturing. DataMatrix barcodes can store up to 2000 characters. It is sometimes required that [Barcode generated should be in UTF-8 Format][1].

Following is the simple code snippet demonstrating how to generate UTF-8 encoded DataMatrix barcode.
