[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-Java_100.png) We like to share the announcement for Aspose.Slides for Java 8.2.0. This is a major releases where we have introduced new features and fixed a number of existing rendering issues from earlier versions.

This release has enhanced support for SmartArt loading, saving, editing, and 2d-rendering of objects. For more information about these features, please visit Working with SmartArt Shapes documentation section.

## New Features

Some of our customers have asked for a way to preset the zoom level for output presentations when viewed in Microsoft PowerPoint. To fullfil this requirement, we have introduced support for setting the zoom level of generated PowerPoint presentations. Earlier, Aspose.Slides defaulted to 100% zoom level.

The support for automatic update of linked OLE frame data has also been introduced in this version. With this feature  any changes to linked OLE frame files are reflected in generated presentations. Please read Setting OleFrame Update Mode to see how this feature can be used.

We have also introduced a feature that lets you set multilevel chart categories.  Now you can add child nodes for any chart category.

## Fixes

Several presentation rendering issues inside exported PDF and slides thumbnails including improper text rendering, improper chart rendering, missing or improperly rendered images and corrupt PDFs have been resolved in this release.
