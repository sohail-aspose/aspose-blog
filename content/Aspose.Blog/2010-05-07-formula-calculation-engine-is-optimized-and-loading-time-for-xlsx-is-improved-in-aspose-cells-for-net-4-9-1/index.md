We are pleased to release Aspose.Cells for .NET 4.9.1 for the users.

In the new version, we have provided Aspose.Cells for .NET Framework Client Profile version for the users. We have also enhanced the performance of Formula Calculation Engine. The opening/loading time for the Xlsx file is further minimized. Moreover, you can now create a named range by directly providing its address in the format, e.g. “A1:B10” or “"$9:$9"”. 

In the Windows Grid provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET, we have supported to import your desired worksheet only in the workbook. You can also get the selected ranges in the worksheet for your need. In the Web Grid provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET, you can control the visibility of horizontal and vertical scroll bars separately.

There are some other fixes and enhancements too.
