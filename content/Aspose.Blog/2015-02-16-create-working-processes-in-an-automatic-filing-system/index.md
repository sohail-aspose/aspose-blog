## About My World Ltd.



{{< figure align=center src="images/MyWorld-Logo.jpg" alt="My World company logo">}}


[My World Ltd.][1] is a software and web application development company, established in Israel since 2004. We develop a variety of software solutions, database management systems, internet websites, portals, and web applications. Among our long-standing clients are high- tech companies, large organizations, and medium private sector businesses, for which we offer a full package deal consisting of the definition, coordination, and application of each project.

My World Ltd. believes in tailored solutions for each individual client, based on innovation, commercial viability, and high technical standards.

## Problem

We advise and develop an automatic filing system for one of our customers that needed a working process that would be able to recognize the document that was uploaded to an intranet SharePoint list, convert the document into a pdf file, send the document to the person responsible for the type of document that was sent and file the original document in the correct folder for the type of document. Initially, there was a “pool” of documents in a SharePoint list that were relayed (_or NOT_) converted to PDF by one of the personal, who kept complaining “this is not my job”. The main problem was recognizing the document type by its content directly from the server, quickly and efficiently, since there were a lot of different file formats (_PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc_), we needed a tool that shall give us access to any file format data. Furthermore, we needed to convert any type of document to PDF format, which shall give the content an official look and shall close it for changes.

## Solution

My World solution was to create a set of SharePoint conditions and actions, which need to recognize the document type by an algorithm and then process the document data, send it to the person responsible and save it in the correct folder. We started looking for a solution that shall enable our developers to work with data from any type of document and shall enable them to quickly convert any type of document to a PDF file format.

## Experience

My World looked at a number of different solutions before deciding on [Aspose.Total for .NET][2]. [Aspose trials][3] gave our developers a glimpse of how hard, resource and time consuming it can be to incorporate other solutions in our working process development when their documentation is lacking information that our developers need to accomplish their tasks, or their solution does not do the job, or they are not fast enough as we required. My World decided to use [Aspose.Total for .NET][4] because it had more features, full documentation, and examples, better licensing, and is more cost-effective than the other solutions.

Is was easy to install and just as easy to use and incorporate with our solution. Everything our developers needed they found in [documentation][5] and examples available on the Aspose website. What was once a “pool” of documents that no one wanted to file and was considered to be a random set of documents with data no one knew how to use, has now become one of the immediate and most organized resources in the organization. Sending documents for filing is now a simple process of just uploading a document. The users feel secured that their document will be sent to the right person and it will be filed correctly.

## Next Steps

We plan to use [Aspose.Total for .NET][6] to create more conditions and actions for SharePoint and other systems. Furthermore, our next focus is to use [Aspose.OCR for .NET][7] to automatically save scanned documents in SharePoint folders.

## Summary

My World chose [Aspose.Total for .NET][8] because it was easy to use, complete [documentation][9], has better licensing terms and is cost-effective. It allows the company to create a working solution for automatically filing documents easily and efficiently.

[Aspose.Total for .NET][10] helped My World to extend its development in the world of AI filing systems.
