Aspose.Diagram for .NET 2.8.0 has been released. We are pleased to announce that this release supports refreshing the data of shapes linked from Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access and SQL server databases.  Based on this feature, Aspose.Diagram for .NET API provides the [handy Refresh method][2] whose overloads allow you to specify the appropriate connection type.

A new [Shape member, the OneD property][3] has been introduced. This determines whether the shape behaves as a one-dimensional object. This release also includes the most recent bug fixes and enhanced HTML5 standard compatibility.

To view a complete list of new features and fixes and to download the new release of Aspose.Diagram for .NET, please [visit the download page][4].
