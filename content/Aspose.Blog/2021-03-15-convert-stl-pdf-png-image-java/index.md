[STL][2] files are used to show the geometry of 3D surfaces. However, only a few CAD-related applications support viewing or working with STL files. Therefore, you may need to convert STL files to a PDF or a PNG image. It will let you overview the file in many operating systems and environments because PDF or image file formats are widely supported. Let us walk through the following sections to find more details:

*   [Convert STL to PDF Programmatically using Java][4]
*   [Convert STL to PNG Image Programmatically with Java][5]

## STL to PNG Image or PDF Conversion – Java API Installation {#section1}

STL files are also known as stereolithographic files as they are used to store 3D geometrical information. You can convert the STL file with [Aspose.CAD for Java][6] API. You can easily utilize the STL conversion feature without needing any other 3rd party application. Simply configure your Java environment by downloading the JAR file from the [Downloads][7] section, or with the following specifications in your Maven-based applications:

## Convert STL to PDF Programmatically using Java {#section2}

You can follow the following steps for converting STL files to PDF programmatically using Java:

1.  Specify the path for the input STL file.
2.  Load input STL file with [CadImage][8] class object.
3.  Initialize [PdfOptions][9] class instance.
4.  Convert STL to PDF.

The code below shows how to convert STL to PDF programmatically with Java:

## Convert STL to PNG Image Programmatically with Java {#section3}

Please use the following steps for converting STL file to PNG image in your Java applications:

1.  Load input STL image.
2.  Initialize [PngOptions][10] class instance.
3.  Convert STL to PNG image.

The following code demonstrates how to convert STL to PNG image programmatically using Java:
