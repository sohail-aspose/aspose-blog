A newer version of the Aspose.Flash for Reporting Services is now available for download. In Aspose.Flash for Reporting Services 1.2.0, we have provided support for Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Reporting Services. This release has been extensively tested with SQL Server 2008 R2.  
  
We have provided both the MSI and DLL only versions. You can download the latest release from the [Aspose.Flash for Reporting Services][1] download section. If you just want to have a look at the documentation in offline mode initially, you can download it as well from [this link][2].
