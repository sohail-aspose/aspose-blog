## OBJ Converter to FBX or STL File using C# {#section1}

[Aspose.3D for .NET][7] API supports working with different 3D models and file formats. You can convert 3D Object files with OBJ file extension to different formats like FBX or STL. Simply configure the API by downloading the DLL files from the [Downloads][8] section, or use the below [NuGet][9] installation command:

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.3D
```

## Convert OBJ to FBX File Programmatically in C# {#section2}

You can convert a 3D Object OBJ file to FBX format with the steps below:

1.  Load input OBJ file with Scene class.
2.  Initialize [FBXSaveOptions][10] object with [FileFormat][11] field.
3.  Convert OBJ to FBX file.

The code below explains how to convert an OBJ object file to an FBX format file programmatically with C#:

## OBJ to STL File Conversion using C# {#section3}

You can convert an OBJ file to an STL file with the following steps:

1.  Load input OBJ file with Scene class.
2.  Initialize [STLSaveOptions][12] class object.
3.  Configure the look up paths to allow finding external dependencies.
4.  Convert OBJ to STL file.

The following code shows how to convert an OBJ file to STL file programmatically in C#:
