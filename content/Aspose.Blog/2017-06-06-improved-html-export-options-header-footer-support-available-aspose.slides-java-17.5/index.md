We are pleased to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Java 17.5. This is primarily a maintenance release whereby we have resolved certain issues incurring in API.

## New Features

Now, you can also export the slides to SVG by setting custom shape IDs that can be used by developers in their processing of exported SVG. Please visit the documentation article, [Generating an SVG with Custom Shape IDs][1]. We have also enhanced the HTML export for presentation by providing custom controller to embed fonts. Please visit documentation article, [Embed All Fonts When Converting Presentation to HTML][2]. We have improved the Header/Footer support in Aspose.Slides and now you can set Header/Footer on individual slides level for normal slides, layout slides, and master slides. It is pertinent to mention that if Header/Footer is defined on Master slide level then every layout slides and their respective normal slides shall inherit the same Header/Footer properties. Please visit documentation articles, [Setting Footer Visibility inside Slide][3] and [Setting Child Footer Visibility inside Slide][4] for further details.

## Resolved Issues

We have improved presentation rendering support in this API and have rectified issues related to text and images rendering inside exported SVG, PDF and slide thumbnails. We have also rectified issues related to exception thrown while accessing or saving presentation files in this release.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for Java 17.5 Release Notes][5] for further reference.
