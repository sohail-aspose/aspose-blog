The input image can be a contract or an agreement between two or more parties. Such an image can be signed digitally for the efficient processing of documents. Subsequently, you need to follow the steps below for signing an image in Java:

*   Firstly, create an instance of the [Image][6] class to load the primary PSD file.
*   Similarly load the secondary PSD image.
*   Mention the position coordinates to set the signature image.
*   Finally, call the [Save][7] method to write the output signed image.

The code snippet below demonstrates how to sign an image in Java:
