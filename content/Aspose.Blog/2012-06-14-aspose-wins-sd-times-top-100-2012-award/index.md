**[![SD Times 100 2012 Award logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/06/2012SDT100_logo_120x123.gif)USA, Texas – June 1, 2012** **–** [SD Times][2], the software development magazine, recognizes the innovation and leadership of companies, non-profit organizations, open source projects and other initiatives in their annual Top 100 awards. This year, Aspose was included in the Libraries & Frameworks category. It is the fourth year that Aspose receives an SD Times Top 100 award.

The SD Times 100 is not a product award but awards leadership in a variety of software development industry areas. Nominations are submitted by SD Times readers and editors and winners are selected by the SD Times editorial board. The editorial board considers each company's products and reputation and listens to the buzz around the company. They pick their top 100 after much research and debate. As the board writes in [this year's announcement][3]:

"Over several months, we carefully review all the players in the industry. We whittle down the list to the top leaders and innovators, based on their achievements in the previous calendar year. We take into consideration each company's offerings reputation and "buzz"—the attention and conversation we've heard around the company and its products and technologies. Many factors point to leadership within the software development industry."

To reflect how companies cluster, categories are flexible and can change from year to year. Aspose has previously featured in the Components category ([SD Times Top 100 2011][4] Components & Libraries category ([SD Times Top 100 2010][5] & [SD Times Top 100 2009][6]. The other categories this year boast household names such Apple, Google and Microsoft, as well as a number of other well-known companies. It's inspiring to be in such good company.

We hope that our attention to our customers' needs, hard work and ongoing innovation will continue to impress both our customers and the SD Times.

[The full list of winners is on the SD Times website][7].
