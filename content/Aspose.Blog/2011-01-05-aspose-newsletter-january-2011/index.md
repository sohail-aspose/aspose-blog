#### Happy New Year!

Hello! My name is Danny Cooper and I am a member of the business team here at Aspose. I am located in Texas, and I oversee our North American business operations. For the many members of our audience I have not previously met, I'm glad to meet you.  
  
We, Aspose, have a lot of exciting things planned this year, and one of those things is livening up a bit. By that I mean becoming more personable. Last month my colleague John Owens wrote in this section. He's located in Scotland and oversees our European business operations. He and I will share this section of the newsletter, alternating month-to-month.  
  
Outside of the newsletter, you'll also begin seeing Aspose more in the social media community. We've been slow to reach out in this way, but this year we're focused on doing better. We want to keep in touch and interact with you, our customers and friends.  
  
Another exciting thing I get to announce is a new partnership with Perpetuum Software. Their [Silverlight Viewer for Reporting Services][1] now offers direct support for [Aspose rendering extensions][2]. If you use our products you can receive a nice discount on Perpetuum's viewer. You can find out more information on that below.  
  
Lastly, before I close, I want to remind everyone about the "25% off Aspose.Total special" we have going on. The special will close after January 31st so if you have interest please be sure to take advantage while there is still plenty of time.  
  
I sincerely thank you for your interest in our products, and for reading our newsletter. I look forward to visiting with you more soon.  
  
Many thanks,  
  
Danny Cooper, Aspose Texas Team Leader
