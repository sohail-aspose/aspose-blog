**Sydney, Australia - October 10, 2011** - Aspose products help developers work with a wide variety of file formats from within their own applications. Many of our products are developed with specific business processes in mind: [Aspose.Words][1] works with word processing files, [Aspose.Cells][2] works with spreadsheets and [Aspose.Slides][3] works with presentation files. The APIs and GUI controls that we provide save developers days of effort, freeing them up to focus on their own business logic instead of getting lost in file format management and conversion.

[![Aspose.Imaging for .NET icon][4]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2011/10/aspose-imaging-net_icon.png)[Aspose.Imaging][5] brings easy image conversion and manipulation to developers who work in the .NET environment. As with all of our products, Aspose.Imaging provides features that go beyond the native capabilities of the development platform. It works independent of other applications and although Aspose.Imaging allows you to save to Adobe PhotoShop® format (PSD), you do not need PhotoShop on the machine.

## Image Manipulation

Re-sizing or converting images can be memory-intensive; developing a working algorithm takes time and research. Aspose.Imaging has powerful features for file conversion and we have put a lot of work in to make sure that it is efficient and fast. Aspose.Imaging allows you to convert image files to PSD, BMP, JPEG, PNG, TIFF or GIF.

Conversion isn't the only features that Aspose.Imaging offers. You can also use Aspose.Imaging to draw. A set of pens, brushes and fonts allow you to draw images or add new elements and text to existing images.

## Supported Platforms

Aspose.Imaging works with ASP.NET Web applications, Windows desktop applications and even Silverlight 3. The API is written in managed C# and can be used with any of the .NET supported languages: C#, VB.NET, J# and so on.

To give developers of how to use Aspose.Imaging, and show its various features, the API comes with demos and worked examples written in C# and VB.NET.

## Free Trial
