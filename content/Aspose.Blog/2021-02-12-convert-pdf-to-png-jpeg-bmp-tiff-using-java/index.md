[PDF][6] format is ruling the world of digital documents because of its cross-platform support. However, in certain cases, you have to convert PDF files to other file formats. For such cases, this article covers how to convert PDF files to popular image formats. Particularly, you will learn **how to convert PDF to [PNG][7], [JPEG][8], [BMP][9], and [TIFF][10] images using Java**.

## Java PDF to Image Converter API {#Java-PDF-to-Image-Converter-API}

In this article, we'll use [Aspose.PDF for Java][17] which is designed to create new as well as manipulate existing PDF files. The API provides high fidelity conversion of PDF files into various document and image formats. You can either [download][18] API's JAR or install it using the following Maven configurations.

## Convert PDF File to PNG Image using Java {#Convert-PDF-File-to-PNG-using-Java}

In PDF to PNG conversion, each page of the PDF file is converted into a separate PNG image. Thus, you can convert a single page, all pages, or specific pages of the PDF as per your scenario. The following are the steps to convert a PDF file to PNG using Java.

*   Load the PDF file using [Document][19] class.
*   Loop through the pages in PDF file using [Document.getPages()][20] method.
*   Create [OutputStream][21] object for each PNG image.
*   Instantiate the [Resolution][22] class to set the resolution of rendered images.
*   Create an object of [PngDevice][23] class and initialize it with the [Resolution][24] object.
*   Use [PngDevice.process(Document.getPages().get\_Item(Index), OutputStream)][25] method to convert PDF page to PNG image.
*   Close the file stream.

The following code sample shows how to convert PDF to PNG image using Java.

## Convert PDF File to JPEG Image using Java {#Convert-PDF-File-to-JPEG-using-Java}

The following are the steps to convert pages in a PDF file to JPEG images using Java.

*   Load the PDF file using [Document][26] class.
*   Loop through the pages in PDF using [Document.getPages()][27] method.
*   Create [OutputStream][28] object for each JPEG image.
*   Instantiate the [Resolution][29] class to set the resolution of rendered images.
*   Create an object of [JpegDevice][30] class and initialize it with the [Resolution][31] object.
*   Use [JpegDevice.process(Document.getPages().get\_Item(Index), OutputStream)][32] method to convert PDF page to JPEG image.
*   Close the file stream.

The following code sample shows how to convert PDF pages to JPEG images using Java.

## PDF to BMP Image Conversion using Java {#PDF-to-BMP-Conversion-using-Java}

The following are the steps to perform PDF to BMP conversion in Java.

*   Use the [Document][33] class to load the PDF file.
*   Iterate through the PDF pages using [Document.getPages()][34] method.
*   Create [OutputStream][35] object for each BMP image.
*   Instantiate the [Resolution][36] class to set the resolution of rendered images.
*   Create an object of [BmpDevice][37] class and initialize it with the [Resolution][38] object.
*   Use [BmpDevice.process(Document.getPages().get\_Item(Index), OutputStream)][39] method to convert PDF page to BMP image.
*   Close the file stream.

The following code sample shows how to perform PDF to BMP image conversion in Java.

{{< gist aspose-pdf 474c352a71ac9477aa0d604fd32e1c6a "Examples-src-main-java-com-aspose-pdf-examples-NewDocumentObject-images-ConvertPDFPagesToBMPImage-ConvertAllPDFPagesToBMPImages.java" >}}

## PDF to TIFF Conversion using Java {#PDF-to-TIFF-Conversion-using-Java}

In contrast to the above-mentioned raster image formats, TIFF is a multipage image format. Therefore, you can convert a PDF file to TIFF at once without looping through each page. On the other hand, you can also specify a range of pages in PDF to be converted to TIFF. The following are the steps to convert a PDF file to TIFF using Java.

*   Use the [Document][40] class to load the PDF file.
*   Create [OutputStream][41] object for TIFF image.
*   Instantiate the [Resolution][42] class to set the resolution of rendered images.
*   Use [TiffSettings][43] class to set additional options such as compression type, color depth, etc.
*   Create an object of [TiffDevice][44] class and initialize it with the [Resolution][45] object.
*   Use [TiffDevice.process(Document, OutputStream)][46] method (or other [overload methods][47] to specify a range of pages) to convert PDF to TIFF.
*   Close the file stream.

The following code sample shows how to convert a PDF file to TIFF image using Java.

{{< gist aspose-pdf 474c352a71ac9477aa0d604fd32e1c6a "Examples-src-main-java-com-aspose-pdf-examples-NewDocumentObject-images-ConvertPDFPagesToTIFFImage-ConvertOnePageToTIFF.java" >}}
