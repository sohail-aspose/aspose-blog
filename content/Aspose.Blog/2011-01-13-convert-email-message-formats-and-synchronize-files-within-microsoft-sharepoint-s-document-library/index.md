We are pleased to announce the new family member of our SharePoint products, Aspose.Network for SharePoint. It provides email message file format conversion and files/emails synchronization within Microsoft SharePoint’s document library. Aspose.Network for SharePoint consists of three sub-products.

**Email Conversion**

Provides email message file format conversion (EML to MSG and vice versa) within the SharePoint’s Document Library. Extraction of attachments from email is also supported.

**Files Synchronization with FTP Server**

Provides file synchronization features between SharePoint’s Document Library and FTP server. The synchronization takes place after a regular interval of time and does the file transfer. FTP servers with SSL are also supported. If you do not want the synchronization, you can also just select and send any file(s) from the document library to the FTP server.

**Emails Synchronization with POP3, IMAP or Microsoft Exchange Server**

Provides emails synchronization features between SharePoint’s “Custom List of Emails” and a supported mail server (POP3, IMAP or Microsoft Exchange). SSL is also supported for all of these. Aspose.Network for SharePoint will automatically connect to the mail server and download the emails after the specified interval of time.
