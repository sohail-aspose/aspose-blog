[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/aspose-Imaging-for-net_100.png)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Imaging for .NET 2.1.0. This months' release is mainly about enhancing the recently provided feature DXF AutoCad 2010 file format conversion to PDF. Aspose.Imaging for .NET 2.0.0 provided this feature with all the widespread 2D entities and basic parameters, whereas Aspose.Imaging for .NET 2.1.0 adds support for the following aspects while converting **DXF AutoCad** 2010 file formats to **PDF**:

1.  Rotated MTEXT shifting.
2.  Splitting of MTEXT special symbols.
3.  Spline objects.
4.  Dimension filling for AutoCAD default arrows.

In this new release, we have made some significant improvements to the TIFF codecs. Due to these modifications, the Aspose.Imaging for .NET component can now load and manipulate **CIELAB** & **CMYK** type **TIFF** images without raising an exception. Along with these enhancements we have fixed some bugs in the component, such as preserving the transparency while converting a GIF image to PNG, and a few resolution related issues reported with JPEG and TIFF image formats.

Find out what's new and what's fixed in [Aspose.Imaging for .NET 2.1.0][2].
