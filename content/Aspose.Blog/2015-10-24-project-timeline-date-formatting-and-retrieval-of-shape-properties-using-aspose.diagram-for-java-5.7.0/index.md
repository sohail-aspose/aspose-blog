[![Aspose.Diagram for Java logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/aspose_diagram-for-java.png)We're pleased to announce the new release version 5.7.0 of Aspose.Diagram for Java APIs. This new release version allows users to format date of the project Timeline specified by date pattern strings. We’ve also added improvement in reference of the recovery of shape's properties, bug fixes and many other enhancements are incorporated.

## Set the Date Pattern Strings on a Timeline Visio
