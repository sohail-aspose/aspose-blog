We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Java 18.5. We have improved the API features support by introducing support adding custom positions for SmartArt nodes along with the resolution of outstanding issues.

## Set Custom Position for Child Nodes in SmartArt using Java

Now Aspose.Slides for Java support for setting SmartArtShape X and Y properties. The code snippet below shows how to set custom SmartArtShape position, size and rotation. Also, please note that adding new nodes causes a recalculation of the positions and sizes of all nodes. Also with custom position settings, user may set the nodes as per requirements.
