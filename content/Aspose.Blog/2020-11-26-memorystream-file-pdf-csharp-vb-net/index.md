[MemoryStream][2] is frequently used because of its efficiency and ease. You can convert a MemoryStream to a [PDF][3] File as well as a PDF File to a MemoryStream Programmatically using C# or VB.NET. One of the many advantages of using a MemoryStream is that the system can avoid the latencies which are common while reading or writing files on a disk, or a FileStream. Moreover, physical space on the disk is not utilized because the contents stay in the memory. For instance, if you have a file loaded in a MemoryStream and you would need to process it further, you do not need to write that file on the disk and then read from there. Instead, you can easily and quickly utilize the file contents from the MemoryStream. Let us explore MemoryStream to File and a File to MemoryStream conversion using C#, under the following headings:
