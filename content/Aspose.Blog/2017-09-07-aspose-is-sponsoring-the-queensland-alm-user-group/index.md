[](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/08/westwindlogo.png)The Queensland ALM Users Group (QALMUG) is a non-profit association of people in Australia who are interested in Application Lifecycle Management, Microsoft Visual Studio and its associated products, technologies and practices. They aim to gather once a month and will usually have a top notch speaker which may include international speakers, INETA speakers, or even local talent, of which there is an incredible amount. They have a chance to socialize over a free breakfast and drinks provided by our sponsors along with some great prizes too.

Aspose loves getting behind developers in the community which is why we are sponsoring the Queensland ALM user group. We recommend if you are in in the neighbourhood to go [check them out][2].
