We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.BarCode for .NET 18.4][1]. This release brings an exciting feature of support for .NET Standard 2.0 (.NET Core) for our users. We have also fixed the issue when incorrect text is provided for some encode types. For a detailed note on what is new and fixed, please visit the [release notes section][2] of API documentation of Aspose.BarCode for .NET.

## Generate Barcodes in .NET Standard 2.0 Applications

Starting from Aspose.BarCode for .NET 18.4, this API includes .NET Standard 2.0 version. We have ported complete functionality of regular .NET version of Aspose.BarCode, into .NET Standard 2.0 version. However, only a few limitations are there. The following are the details.

*   Import TIFF image is not supported.
*   Import vector image is not supported.
*   Export to TIFF image format is not supported.
*   Export to vector image format is not supported.

## Improvements

This release also includes improvement in terms of bug fixes which further add to the overall stability of the API. These are related to various API functionality and include:

*   **_ThrowExceptionWhenCodeTextIncorrect_** property is working incorrectly. This issue has been fixed in a way that if incorrect text is supplied for encode types SwissPostParcel, SingaporePost and Databars, it will throw **_codetext is invalid_** exception.
