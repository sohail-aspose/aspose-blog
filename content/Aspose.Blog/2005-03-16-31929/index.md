We are very excited to announce that this coming month [Aspose.Pdf][1] is going to be featured in [PC Plus magazine][2]. PC Plus will offer a fully functional, early version of the product (1.7.3) and will also offer an editorial that explains what all that the component has to offer. [Aspose.Pdf][3] is a very powerful, PDF document management component that offers developers a wealth of PDF creation features. If you have not had an opportunity to review the [Aspose.Pdf][4] package, we encourage you to do so and see how that it can work for you! Also be sure to check out the rest of our new PDF products: **Aspose.Pdf.Fo**, **Aspose.Pdf.Form** and **Aspose.Pdf.Kit**!
