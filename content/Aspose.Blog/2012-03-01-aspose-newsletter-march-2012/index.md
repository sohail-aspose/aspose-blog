## We're celebrating our 10th birthday!

Aspose has been in business for 10 years. Over the years the company has grown and gone from one small team in Australia to several teams all over the world. It has been a fun 10 years and we have learned a lot. We want to thank all of our customers, from the very first company that invested in us, to the most recent. We'll continue to listen to what you tell us you need in the years to come.

Our aim is constant: to provide products and services that save our customers time and money. We're developers who want to make the lives of other developers easier. We work to deliver products and services to developers who work with Office documents and file formats. Aspose's file format expertise is at your service.

From all of us at Aspose, thank you for you support!

## Discontinued Products

In September we changed the name of Aspose.Network to Aspose.Email to better reflect what the product was used for. We also separated out network programming features from Aspose.Email for .NET and made them available as a free utility, Aspose.Network for .NET. This free utility will be discontinued from March 15th, 2012. [Find out more][40].
