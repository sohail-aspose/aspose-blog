We are excited to share the news of extension in [Aspose.Words product family][1]. The news is also of excitement for application developers who would love to incorporate Word document processing functionalities in their native **C++** applications. It will be a native C++ library that will allow the developers to create, manipulate and convert Word documents programmatically without requiring Office Automation or Microsoft Word application. All of our experience of Word document processing goes into this new platform to provide quality API which is native and can be used on different operating systems alike with high performance.

Aspose, a file formats API provider, has decided to add the support of C++ to the Aspose.Words product. The name of this product will be **Aspose.Words for C++**. This new Aspose.Words for C++ API will most likely be released during next month.
