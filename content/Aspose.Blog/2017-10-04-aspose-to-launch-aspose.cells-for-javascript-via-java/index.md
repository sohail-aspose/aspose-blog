We are pleased to share the news of extension in [Aspose.Cells product family][1]. The news is also of excitement for application developers who would love to incorporate MS Excel spreadsheet processing functionalities in JavaScript which is most commonly used as a client-side scripting language. JavaScript can be used in other contexts than web browser JavaScript applications.  
[  
Aspose](https://www.aspose.com/), a file formats API provider, has decided to launch Aspose.Cells for JavaScript via Java. Aspose.Cells for JavaScript is a subset component that includes all the important and useful features present in its native Aspose.Cells for Java. The new API will be an equally robust, scalable and feature-rich component. You will be able to utilize high-fidelity file format conversions to and from XLS, XLSX, XLSM, SpreadsheetML, CSV, Tab Delimited, HTML, MHTML and OpenDocument Spreadsheet in JavaScript via node-java bridge. The developers will have full programmatic access through rich APIs set to all MS Excel document objects and formattings that allows creating, modify, extract, copy, merge, and replace spreadsheet content. With Aspose.Cells for JavaScript via Java, developers can export data, format spreadsheets to the most granular level, create, manipulate and render charts, apply and calculate complex formulas efficiently and much more. All you need to do is install [Node.js SDK][2] for your specific platform and setup [node-java][3] bridge. Another good thing about the Docs is we will be using one common [JAVA Docs][4] (i.e., Aspose.Cells for Java) for Aspose.Cells for JavaScript via Java as well.

This new Aspose.Cells for JavaScript via Java API will be released @ the end of October 2017 or at the start of next month.
