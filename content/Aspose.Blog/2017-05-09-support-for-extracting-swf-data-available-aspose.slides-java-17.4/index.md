[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-Java_100.png) We are pleased to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Java 17.4. We have included some new features support along with resolution of outstanding issues in this release.

## New Features

Now, you can access the embedded SWF file data inside presentation and can even extract that using Aspose.Slides. Please visit documentation article, [Extracting Flash objects from Presentation][2] for more details. Now, you can also verify if any given presentation has been crated or modified using Aspose.Slides. For further details, please visit documentation article, [Check if Presentation is Modified or Created][3] .

## Resolved Issues

We have improved the charting support and issues related to line charts and chart data labels. We have also resolved the issues related to presentation access and saving which earlier resulted in different exceptions like, ArgumentNullException, NullReferenceException and NullPointerException. We have also rectified the corrupt presentations and error message appearing issue for saved presentations as well.

We have improved presentation rendering support in this API and have rectified issues related to text, image, charts, table cells, borders and other shapes rendering inside exported SVG, PDF and slide thumbnails. We have also resolved the issues related to slides cloning and have resolved certain incurring issues including presentation layouts getting disturbed, broken text inside paragraphs and fonts styles getting changed in cloned presentations.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for Java 17.4 Release Notes][4] for further reference.
