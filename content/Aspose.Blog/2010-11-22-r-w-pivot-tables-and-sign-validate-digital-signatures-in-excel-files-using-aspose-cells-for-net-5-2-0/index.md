We have published Aspose.Cells for .NET v5.2.0 for the users.

In this version, we have supported signing and validating Digital Signatures in XLSX files. We have also supported to read/write and manipulate Pivot Tables in both XLS and XLSX files. The GridWeb control now supports to import/export images in Excel spreadsheets. The GridDesktop control allows you to import/export named ranges.

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
