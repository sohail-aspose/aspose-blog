We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Email for Java][1] 3.9.0. Ported from its Aspose.Email for .NET 3.9.0, it has the same new features and enhancements.

Like Aspose.Email for .NET, Aspose.Email for Java now offers the capability to move items from one folder to another in a Personal Storage (PST) file. This includes moving messages as well as subfolders to new parent folder as shown in our online article Moving Items to Other Folders in PST.

This month’s release also provides a new feature that lets you load Google tasks exported to ICS format. The VToDo item can be loaded using the MapiTask class object which can then save it as standard Outlook MSG format or add to PST.

We have also fixed a number of bugs in this month’s release, resulting in an overall improvement in the API’s functionality. For further information on what is new and fixed, please refer to the [product download page][2].
