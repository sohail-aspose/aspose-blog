This is a maintenance release that includes a Java version of fixes that were made in:

*   [Aspose.Words for .NET 4.2.2][1]
*   [Aspose.Words for .NET 4.2.3][2]
*   [Aspose.Words for .NET 4.2.4][3]
*   [Aspose.Words for .NET 4.2.5][4]
*   [Aspose.Words for .NET 4.2.6][5]
*   [Aspose.Words for .NET 4.3.0][6]
*   [Aspose.Words for .NET 4.3.1][7]

The highlight of this release is:

· A great deal more of resiliency in the import of DOC files in Aspose.Words – reading of inconsistent/corrupted DOC files.

· Added public API to create footnotes and control footnote properties.

· Support of CSS shorthand attributes in HTML import. The very populat "font", "margins", "padding", "background", “border” attributes are now supported.

· The size of generated files is optimized - if the same image occurs multiple times in the document it is written to DOC and HTML files only once.
