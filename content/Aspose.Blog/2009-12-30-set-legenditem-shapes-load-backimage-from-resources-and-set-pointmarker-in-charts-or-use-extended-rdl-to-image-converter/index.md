Aspose.Report for .NET 2.2.0 has been released. This release supports RDL expressions including arithmetical operations, concatenation with type resolution and RowNumber function. Previously, RDL expressions were not supported in the RDL to Image conversion.

This release also includes the features to set any shape for a LegendItem, load DataPointâ€™s BackImage from embedded resources, display rectangle as FrameBorder and display horizontal/vertical lines as point markers in a Point/Line chart. This release also includes some important bug fixes.
