Aspose is proud to announce that we are sponsoring [South Florida Code Camp 2011][1]. The Code Camp will be held on February 12, 2011, 7:30 - 5:45.

Code Camp is a FREE one day GEEK FEST. This is the seventh year for South Florida Code Camp. The event will have speakers from the local community and beyond. Speakers will be presenting some of the most requested topics like ASP.NET AJAX, Visual Studio 2010, MVC Framework, Silverlight, Windows Presentation Foundation, Sharepoint 2010 and SQL Server 2008R2. This event is like Tech-Ed for Free but it's community driven by a group of dedicated volunteers and speakers. Breakfast and lunch is included!  
  
**Location for South Florida Code Camp 2011
