We are pleased to announce new release of [Aspose.Words for JasperReports][1]. We have upgraded this release to the latest version of Aspose.Words for Java 19.1 and fixed an issue related to bottom margin of page. Moreover, we have added new configuration option [BREAK\_TABLE\_ROWS][2] to work with row break across page. We have added another feature to break the page when page setting is changed e.g. page orientation. In such case, the page break is inserted even when [PAGE\_BREAKS][3] configuration option is set to FALSE.

Please see the [release notes][4] for more detail. You can download the latest release of Aspose.Words for JasperReports 19.1 from the following link:
