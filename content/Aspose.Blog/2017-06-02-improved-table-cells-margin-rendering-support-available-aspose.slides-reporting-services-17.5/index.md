We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 17.5.

This release has been developed based on Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.5. Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.5 has some new features including HeaderFooterManager class support for slides, layout slides and Master slides. This will help to set the headers and footers properties on individual slides level. The improved rendering support in Aspose.Slides for .NET will achieve better rendering of SQL Server reports when exporting to PowerPoint or other formats using Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services.

We have also rectified issues related to extra blank pages appearing in exported presentation decks along with issues related to table cells margin for exported reports.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 17.5 Release Notes][1] for further reference.
