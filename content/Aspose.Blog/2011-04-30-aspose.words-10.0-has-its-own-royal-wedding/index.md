Today's Aspose.Words 10.0 release is a wedding ceremony for our two flagship products Aspose.Words for Java and Aspose.Words for .NET. They have finally married for better for worse and will stay together in sickness and in health. All futher releases of Aspose.Words for .NET and Java will be released on the same day and provide the same set set of features and fixes. We are a single development team that works on two products, but on a single source code base, has a single set of features and bugs to fix. Most of the team is C# developers with a sprinkle of Java experts. Having developed our own tool for automatically converting C# source code to Java we use it on the Aspose.Words 500K+ lines of code to produce two products for the two main development platforms.
