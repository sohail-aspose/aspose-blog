[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We are happy to share the announcement of Aspose.Slides for .NET 14.1.0 merged API release. This release is part of the ongoing process to develop a merged Aspose.Slides for .NET API that is at par with the legacy Aspose.Slides for .NET API ([Aspose.Slides for .NET 8.3.0][2]. The legacy Aspose.Slides for .NET API will be phased out once the merged API incorporates all the same features and is fully mature. In the meanwhile, we maintain both the merged as well as legacy API so that our customers can familiarize themselves with the new API.

In this release, we have added support for loading, saving, editing, and rendering 2D SmartArt objects. Our documentation section, working with SmartArt in presentation, gives a working sample.

We have also rectified some reported issues regarding presentation access in this release. There are some known issues in this release and we working on them. We are hopeful to overcome these limitations in upcoming versions.
