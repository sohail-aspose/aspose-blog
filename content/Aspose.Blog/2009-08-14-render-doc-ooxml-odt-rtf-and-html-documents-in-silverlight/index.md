_Document Toolkit_ is a product of First Floor Software and provides a fast and feature-rich XPS document viewer library for Silverlight. The XML Paper Specification (XPS) is a fixed document format similar to PDF. In order to render Word documents in Silverlight, _Document Toolkit_ requires the document to be converted to the XPS format first.

_Aspose.Words for .NET_ is a document processing library by Aspose and provides document conversion to the XPS format. _Aspose.Words_ supports all modern Word documents formats available today including Word 97-2003, Word 2007, WordML and OOXML. Conversion of OpenDocument (ODT), Rich Text Format (RTF) and HTML documents is supported as well.
