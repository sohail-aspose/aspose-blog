We are pleased to inform about the release announcement of [Aspose.Slides for Java][1] 8.0.0. This is mainly a maintenance release in which we have introduced the maiden feature support for replacing the image inside Presentation class's PictureCollection. Now, one can replace the selected image in a PictureCollection. All the shapes in the presentation that use the selected image are automatically updated to use the new image. We have also provided the support for extracting the byte array data for the PictureCollection image as well. For more details about this feature, please visit this documentation link.

We have also improved the rendering support by resolving many chart, bullets and text rendering issues encountered during slide thumbnail generation and PDF across different platforms including Window, Mac and Linux. We have also rectified the issue pertaining to rendering of presentations in threaded environment as well.
