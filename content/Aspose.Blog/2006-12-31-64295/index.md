Just wanted to update people who are waiting for the release of the Aspose.Words RTF importing module. As I recently posted in the support forums, currently it is ready at 70-80%. Almost all document nodes are imported very well, only shapes are not implemented yet. So I need a couple of weeks more to implement them and make sure the whole bunch of unit tests is passing. Hence January 2007 is the date of the final release.

It's a pity I didn't manage to finish the import until new year as planned initially, wanted to do some kind of surprise... Alas, plans usually differ from reality.
