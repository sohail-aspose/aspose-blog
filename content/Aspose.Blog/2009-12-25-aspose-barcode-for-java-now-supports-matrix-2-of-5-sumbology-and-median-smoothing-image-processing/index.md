We added Matrix 2 of 5 symbology support in our latest release of Aspose.BarCode for Java 1.9.0. It supports generation as well as recognition of Matrix 2 of 5 barcodes. We also enhanced the recognition process and added Median Smoothing feature.  
  
This release also consists of some bug fixes. For download and release notes, please visit [http://www.aspose.com/community/files/72/java-components/aspose.barcode-for-java/default.aspx][1].
