[![User group icon][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2011/08/user-group-icon.png) **Texas, USA - 4 November, 11, 2011** - Aspose supports a number of local user groups and events in the US and Europe. The software we design, and the way we work, promotes interaction and communication between teams and individuals. We believe that user groups and good team work helps individuals succeed. Each of us learn from others. Sharing ideas and learning new things keeps us interested and makes us better at what we do. User groups encourage interaction and learning: that's why we support them.

[In August we shared the groups and events that we were supporting this year][2]. Barely three months on, we can add another two events:

*   Desert Code Camp 2011.2
*   MWP, Italy

## Desert Code Camp 2011.2

**When**: 5 November, 2011  
**Where**: Chandler - Gilbert Community College Pecos Campus, 2626 E Pecos Road, Chandler, AZ 85225

Code Camps are free events for and by the coding community. Members share community developed content outside of normal working hours so that anyone who wants to attend can. [Desert Code Camp 2011.2][3] is all about code. This is the third time we sponsor Desert Code Camp and we expect to continue to support them in the future.
