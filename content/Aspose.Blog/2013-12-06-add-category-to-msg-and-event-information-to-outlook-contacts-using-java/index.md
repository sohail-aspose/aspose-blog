We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Email for Java][1] 3.6.0. This release includes a number of enhancements and bug fixes.

We have added a new feature that lets you add a color category to an Outlook MSG file. The FollowUpManager class provides methods for adding, removing and listing the color categories associated with a MSG file. In addition, removing categories from a MSG file is also supported by this class. For a working example, please refer to the article Setting Color Category for Outlook MSG file.

Microsoft Outlook allows developers to set event data for an Outlook contact. With this month’s release, Aspose.Email now supports setting this information using the MapiContactEventPropertySet class. For a detailed example, please refer to the topic Adding Contact Event Information to a MapiContact.

In addition to the enhancements mentioned above, we have also fixed a number of bugs related to MSG conversion to various formats such as EML, MHTML, TIFF, reading Outlook appointments and PST operations. This in turn adds value and improves the overall functionality of the API.

For more details on what is new and fixed, please refer to the Aspose.Email’s [Product Download Page][2].
