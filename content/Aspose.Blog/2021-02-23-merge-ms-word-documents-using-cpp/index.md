## C++ API to Merge Word Documents {#CPP-API-to-Merge-Word-Documents}

[Aspose.Words for C++][5] is a native C++ library that allows you to create, change and convert Microsoft Word documents. In addition, it also supports combining multiple Word documents into a single file. You can either install the API through [NuGet][6] or download it directly from the [Downloads][7] section.

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.Words.Cpp
```

## Merge Word Documents using C++ {#Merge-Word-Documents-using-CPP}

Merging Word documents with Aspose.Words for C++ API is a breeze. You can load and merge them with just a few lines of code. The following is the image showing the two sample Word files that we will combine in this article.

The following are the steps for merging Word documents using C++.

*   Load the destination document using the [Document][8] class.
*   Load the source document using the [Document][9] class.
*   Use the [Document->AppendDocument (System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Document> srcDoc, Aspose::Words::ImportFormatMode importFormatMode)][10] method of the destination document instance to merge both documents.
*   Set the styling preference for importing the source document using the [ImportFormatMode][11] enum.
*   Save the merged Word document using [Document->Save (System::String fileName, Aspose::Words::SaveFormat saveFormat)][12] method.

The following is the sample code to merge Word documents.

## Merge Word Documents with Additional Options {#Merge-Word-Documents-with-Additional-Options}

Aspose.Words for C++ API provides the [ImportFormatOptions][17] class for customizing the merging of Word files. The following are the options provided by the [ImportFormatOptions][18] class.

*   **[IgnoreHeaderFooter][19]**: Specifies whether to ignore the formatting of headers/footers content when the [](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#aafaa52cbf0baa49c3225787c23a8c949)[ImportFormatMode][20]::KeepSourceFormatting mode is used.
*   [**IgnoreTextBoxes**][21]: Specifies whether to ignore the source formatting of textboxes when the [](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/namespace/aspose.words#aafaa52cbf0baa49c3225787c23a8c949)[ImportFormatMode][22]::KeepSourceFormatting mode is used.
*   [**KeepSourceNumbering**][23]: Specifies how to import the numbering when it conflicts in source and destination documents.
*   [**SmartStyleBehavior**][24]: Specifies how to import styles when they have the same names in source and destination documents.

The following are the steps to merge multiple Word documents with additional options:

*   Load the destination document using the [Document][25] class.
*   Load the source document using the [Document][26] class.
*   Create an instance of the [ImportFormatOptions][27] class and set the desired options.
*   Merge the documents using [Document->AppendDocument ( System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Document> srcDoc, Aspose::Words::ImportFormatMode importFormatMode, System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::ImportFormatOptions> importFormatOptions)][28] method.
*   Save the destination Word document using [Document->Save (System::String fileName, Aspose::Words::SaveFormat saveFormat)][29] method.

The following is the sample code to merge Word documents with additional options.
