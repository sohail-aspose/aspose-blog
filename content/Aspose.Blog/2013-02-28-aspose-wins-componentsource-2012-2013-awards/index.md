**[![ComponentSource 2012-2013 Top 5 Publisher Award][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/02/CS-Award-5-Publisher-2012-13-Medium.gif)USA, Texas – February 28, 2012** – ComponentsSource is a leading online software vendor who offers products from over 250 vendors to over 125,000 customers. Every year, they put together a list of the best selling companies and products that they work with. There are two categories: [Bestselling Publisher Awards][2], and [Bestselling Product Awards][3]. Aspose placed in both categories and collected several awards.

We are particularly proud to receive a **Top 5 Best Selling Publisher Award**. This award is based on our sales through ComponentSource, so it is unbiased proof of how popular our products are. There is no better endorsement than our customers voting with their pockets, and trusting their projects to our products. We want to thank all of our customers for their confidence in us and look forward to supporting them throughout 2013-2014.

Best Selling Publisher was not the only Top 5 award we got: [Aspose.Total for .NET][4] netted a **Top 5 Bestselling Product Award**. Aspose.Total brings together all our products for a platform and we're delighted that so many customers decide to use not just one or two of our products, but several.

Our other products collected the following awards:

*   [Aspose.Words for .NET][5] and [Aspose.Total for Java][6] each received a Top 25 Product Award.
*   [Aspose.Cells for .NET][7] received a Top 50 Product Award.
*   [Aspose.Pdf for .NET][8], [Aspose.Words for Java][9] and [Aspose.Total for Reporting Services][10] each received a Top 100 Product Award.
