#### Upcoming products – Aspose.Words version 10.0

We are releasing Aspose.Words version 10.0 soon. To keep the .NET and Java versions of the components in step, we are autoporting code from the .NET product to the Java product. From now on, users of Aspose.Words for Java customers will get the same updates as our Aspose.Words for .NET users. We are grateful for the patience that our Java users have shown while we have been working on this important development.

Want to know how we did it? We have a number of blog entries on autoporting on the Aspose.Word blog. [Watch this video to see what our autoporting process looks like][1].

#### Product Spotlight – Aspose.Pdf for .NET

[Aspose.Pdf for .NET][2] allows you to read, write and manipulate PDF files from within an application, without Adobe Acrobat. Aspose's file format expertise ensures that the component is easy to use and fast to learn whether you are working in a .NET, Java or Reporting Services environment. To support you further, we have made a wide variety of documentation, articles, video tutorials and other information available from the documentation section of our website. Our support team is also here when you need them.

Don't work in a .NET environment? Good news: [Aspose.Pdf for Java][3] and [Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services][4] are also available.

#### Technical Article – Working Solution for Chart Re-sizing

An Excel chart embedded as an OLE object in a PowerPoint presentation using [Aspose.Slides for Java][5] has different sizes before and after chart activation. This is caused by the fact that the spreadsheet and the OLE object each has a set size. When a chart is activated from a PowerPoint slide, a certain amount of negotiation is performed between the two applications. This affects the size of the embedded object when it is closed again. Working with Microsoft, we found a solution to this issue.

#### Tutorial Video – Filtering Data using Aspose.Report for .NET

[Aspose.Report for .NET][6] can be used to create ad-hoc reports and great looking charts. This month's tutorial shows how to filter data in disconnected mode, or without loading it into a data table. A web application created in Microsoft visual Studio illustrates how Aspose.Report for .NETs AdHoc.Web component can be used to filter the data. The result is a report with light-weight filtering built in a little over 12 minutes. Watch the tutorial to learn more.

#### Migration from Excel to Aspose.Cells – Rotating Text in Cells

Do you need to rotate (change the orientation of) text in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet cell programmatically? You can do that using Visual Studio Tools for Office, or, removing VSTO from the equation, Aspose.Cells. We show both methods in this article that compares using VSTO (C#, VB) and [Aspose.Cells for .NET][7] (C#, VB) to rotate text from within your application. Find out how.
