[![Aspose.Pdf for Android logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/aspose-Pdf-for-Android.png)We are excited to announce the release of [Aspose.Pdf for Android 1.4.0][2], which provides complete support for the PdfConverter class and we also have introduced the JpegDevice class. The JpegDevice class specifically provides the capabilities to convert PDF pages to JPEG format and provides high fidelity results. Furthermore, PDF to image conversion, text extraction and text replacement are particular features enhanced in this release.

In this new version, we have also provided support for extracting text using the TextDevice class which was earlier supported in Aspose.Pdf for .NET and Aspose.Pdf for Java. TrueType font support has also been also enhanced and this API is not capable of handling complex scenarios for text replace feature.

Please download and start evaluating the new release of [Aspose.Pdf for Android 1.4.0][3]
