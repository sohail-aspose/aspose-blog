We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Cells for Java 7.5.2. We include some useful enhancements in the new release. For example, you may [add conditional icons set (images) with your data][1] to make it more meaningful. You may also auto-resize the textbox control based on the text or contents. The component now allows you to create a CellArea by using “$” included in the cell address.

This release is also a maintenance release that contains enhancements and fixes for issues reported in the earlier versions. Several important issues have been addressed. For example, issues around rendering Microsoft Excel files, rendering charts, manipulating PivotTables, copying cells, inserting rows and rendering to PDF format have been resolved. Issues pertaining to the formula calculation engine have also been fixed in this release.
