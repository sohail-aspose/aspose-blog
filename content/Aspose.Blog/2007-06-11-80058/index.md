Aspose.Slides for .NET 2.6.22 hot fix contains the following changes:  

*   Fixed: NullReferenceException on reading presentation with Notes without Paragraphs. Actually, MS PowerPoint can't create such presentations so assume that is workaround for broken ppts.
*   Fixed: NullReferenceException on reading presentations with tables created in the PowerPoint 2007.
