We have recently released a new version of Aspose.Network for .NET 5.2. In this version, we fixed various issues related to loading and saving messages with non-English language characters like Japanese, Russian and Swedish. Some other bugs were also fixed which were reported on the forums by our customers. This version is also compatible with .NET framework 4.0 client profile and hence can be used with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework 4.0.
