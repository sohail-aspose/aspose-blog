The last release was a total revamp of user interface which introduced a tabbed-toolbar and all features are now accessible with one click. Today I am excited to announce the **1.5 release** of HTML5 Spreadsheet Editor. The new version comes with new features and fixes with a focus on performance. Read release notes on Github.

### Clear cell formatting and contents

Sometimes we need to quickly erase things. 1.5 adds a new feature to remove formatting and/or contents of a cell with a single click. Learn more about clearing cells.

### Optimization

In 1.5 version of HTML5 Spreadsheet Editor, we have done many internal changes that significantly **improves its performance**. Learn more about component structure.

### User Interface

There are some UI fixed in 1.5 release. The height of the sheet was annoying and many times resulted in **two scrollbars on the right-side** of screen. The issue has been fixed.

The user cannot use the scrollbars to scroll up the toolbars. Their position is now fixed. The user can now scroll the cells area only and the **toolbars will always remain visible** all the time while scrolling.
