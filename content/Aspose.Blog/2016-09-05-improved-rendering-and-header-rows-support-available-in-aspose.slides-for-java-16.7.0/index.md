[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-Java_100.png) We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for Java 16.7.0. This is primarily a maintenance release where we have addressed many issues incurring in product.

## New Features

We have introduced the support for enabling Header rows or banned rows for tables inside slide and you can now use this feature to add Header rows. The support for removing the embedded audio inside presentation has also been added in this release and with this feature you can now remove the embedded audios if it is intended

## Resolved Issues

The presentation access and saving issues have been rectified for many presentation decks that resulted in exceptions including NullPointerException, ArgumentException, UnSupportedFormatException and OutofMemoryError in previous releases. We have also improved the slide cloning support and have resolved several incurring issues in this regard as well.

We have improved the presentation rendering support as well in this release. This includes rectification of rendering issues with charts and their elements, tables and SmartArt shapes. The support for generating of slide images, PDF and Tiff has also been improved in this release for different shape elements inside presentation decks.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to Aspose.Slides for Java 16.7.0 Release Notes for further reference.
