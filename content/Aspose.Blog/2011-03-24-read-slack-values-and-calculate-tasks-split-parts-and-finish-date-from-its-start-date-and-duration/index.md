Aspose.Tasks for .NET 3.7.0 has been released. This release supports reading slack (start, finish and total) values as well as start and finish variance values from MS Project 2010 MPP files. This release also supports calculating task’s split parts as well as task’s finish date from its start date and duration. You can use **GetFinishDateByStartAndWork** method of the **Calendar** class to calculate finish date and **SplitParts** property of the **Task** class to get a collection of split parts of a task. Ignoring incorrect values from damaged project files and reading **IsCritical** flag from MPP files is also supported in this release.
