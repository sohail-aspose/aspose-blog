Aspose.Report for Java 1.5.0 has been released. This release includes support for multiple chart borders. You can choose any chart border which suits your needs.

You can also set separate background color and gridlines for the radar in a Radar chart. Previously, background color could be set for complete chart area (inside and outside the radar)

Series and SeriesCollection objects are also improved in this release and some new attributes have been included. This release also includes some other features like the ability to handle the wrong set of data, the ability to assign DateTime value to the axis step, and double-precision support for axis and chart points.
