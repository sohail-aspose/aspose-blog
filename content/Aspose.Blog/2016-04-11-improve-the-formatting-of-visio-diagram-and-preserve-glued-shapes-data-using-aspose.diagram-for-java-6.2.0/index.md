[![Aspose.Diagram for Java logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/aspose_diagram-for-java.png)We’re pleased to announce the availability of new version 6.2.0 of the [Aspose.Diagram for Java API][2]. This version focuses on ways to improve the power of formatting in the complex Visio diagrams and protects the unique identifiers of the glued shapes to track the incoming and outgoing nodes. All this would help developers to organize the contents of diagrams in logical relationships. Please also visit Aspose.Diagram for .NET 6.2.0 Release Notes section to go more in the points of interest.

## Formatting the Content of Visio Diagram

Using Aspose.Diagram API, developers are creating and maintaining more complex Visio diagrams than in the past. As the complexity grows, developers employ a number of strategies to keep their diagrams organized and comprehensive. These common solutions lead aligning shapes, applying similar formatting to related shapes, and drawing boxes around shapes to define logical groups. These solutions improve readability and also demand the formatting improvements. So, we have also covered the formatting improvements in this version.

## Protect the Glued Shapes Data

We have made improvements in routing mechanism to address the connections of glued shapes. This helps developers to track the flow of nodes as the clarity is important in diagrams. The opposite directions may create ambiguity about the meaning of the diagram. Please check the newly added bug fixes and enhancements:

*   Fixed: Can't get 2D shape ids when called Shape.GluedShapes method.
    
*   Fixed: VSD to VDX conversion - the text items are missing or misplaced.
    
*   Fixed: VSD to VDX export - the display text of the Bitmap shapes is missing.
    
*   Fixed: VDX to VSDX export generates a corrupt output file.
    
*   Fixed: VDX to VSDX export - The text alignment of the shapes is wrong.
    
*   Fixed: VDX to VSDX export - the Null Reference Exception occurred.
    
*   Fixed: Zip exception occurred when saving diagram in the VSDX.
