[](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/10/Aspose.3d-for-net-100x100.png)We are pleased to introduce Aspose.3D for .NET, our upcoming newer 3D file format API. For the last few months, the product team has been working over an API to manage file formats used in 3D modelling, Gameware and Computer-aided design and manufacturing according to the global trend. Aspose.3D is a new addition, it is useful in handling 3D file formats. Users will be able to customize 3D scenes, convert 3D files into other supported file formats, and work with graphics objects and their animation tasks.

## FBX and STL 3D File Formats Support

Initially, we have added support of FBX (Filmbox) and STL (STereoLithography) file formats and later we’ll keep on extending the quality of existing file formats and also will add other 3D file formats support. The learning curve for the developers will be less and they will be able to get coding solution quickly and easily.

## Aspose.3D API Features

Please take a look at the features supported by our upcoming Aspose.3D for .NET API:

1.  Generate a 3D Scene and save it into the supported file formats
2.  Create a 3D Graphic Mesh
3.  Set up Normals or UV on Graphic Objects
4.  Add the Transformation to a Node
5.  Share Mesh Geometry Data between the Multiple Nodes
6.  Add Animation to a Graphic Object
7.  Add Material to 3D Document

## Independent of any External Software Installation

It is an easy to use class library to work with 3D file formats, it does not depend on any external API or software installation. We have uploaded its first release version, so that our clients could download and use it in their .NET applications. We always welcome the feedback from our users.
