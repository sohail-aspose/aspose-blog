I am happy to announce release of Aspose.Words for .NET 5.2.0 that is now available for [download][1].

**New Feature: Save as MHTML**

We have added a new useful feature: save as MHTML. MHTML is a "web archive" or "single file web page" format. An HTML document and all external resources (images and stylesheets) are stored within a single file. MHTML could be a good option if you need to convert documents to HTML. When saving documents as HTML, Aspose.Words saves images into separate files and it could be cumbersome to deal with them.

Saving into a single MHTML file allows, for example, to easily email the document. We will soon upload a sample that does just that: uses Aspose.Words + Aspose.Network to mail merge into Word documents and email as HTML.

**New Feature: Save as OpenDocument Text (ODT)**

Finally, we are proud to announce the availability of the long awaited OpenDocument support. It is hard to convert Word documents into OpenDocument, but we've done it.

This release also includes big number of fixes in many areas. As always, it is a good idea to stay up to date with the latest version of Aspose.Words.

You can see and try new functionality in the [online demo][2].
