[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for .NET 16.4.0. This is one of maintenance releases whereby we have resolved several issues incurring in product along with inclusion of some new features.

## New Features

We have introduced the support for generating SWF for the presentation. You can save the presentation as SWF by using SaveFormat.SWF enumerator in Presentation.Save() method now. We have also introduced the support for getting X, Y coordinates from paragraphs/portions inside any text frame.

## Resolved Issues

We have improved text rendering support in this API and now issue like improper fonts loading, wrong formatted text in tables/AutoShapes, shadow effect, font heights and text alignment have been resolved in this API. The presentation access and saving issues have been rectified for many presentation decks that resulted in exceptions including PptxReadException, ArgumentException , UnSupportedFormatException and NullReferenceException in previous releases.

Many shapes rendering issues including missing charts, improper table borders, missing shadow effects, missing gradient effects on shapes in exported PDF and slide thumbnails have been rectified in this release.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to Aspose.Slides for .NET 16.4.0 Release Notes for further reference.
