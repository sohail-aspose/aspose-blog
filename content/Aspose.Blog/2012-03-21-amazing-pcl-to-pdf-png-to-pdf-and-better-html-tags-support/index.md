![Aspose.Pdf icon][1]

We are excited to announce the release of [Aspose.Pdf for Java 3.1.0][2]. In this release, we have enhanced the support for PCL (Printer Control Language) files conversion to PDF format and have greatly improved the feature of converting raster images, including PNG and BMP, to PDF. We have alsoÂ introduced a new method - setVerticalAlignment() - to the ImageInfo class to vertically align an image object inside a PDF document. We've also fixed some issues so that Aspose.Pdf is more stable during XML files to PDF conversion.

Please visit the following link for further details on what's new & fixed in [Aspose.Pdf for Java 3.1.0][3].
