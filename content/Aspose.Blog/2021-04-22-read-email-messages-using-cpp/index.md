## C++ API for Reading Email Messages {#CPP-API-for-Reading-Email-Messages}

[Aspose.Email for C++][11] is a native C++ library for creating, manipulating, and sending emails without requiring Microsoft Outlook to be installed. The API also supports reading EML and MSG email files. You can either install the API through [NuGet][12] or download it directly from the [Downloads][13] section.

```
