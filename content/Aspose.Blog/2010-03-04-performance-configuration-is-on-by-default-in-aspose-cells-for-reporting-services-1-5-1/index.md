We have released the Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services v1.5.1 for the users.

In this version, we have enhanced rendering of Editable Charts for SQL Server Reporting Services 2008. We have set the Performance configuration as the default configuration, so the performance would be improved while rendering large reports. There are some other enhancements too.
