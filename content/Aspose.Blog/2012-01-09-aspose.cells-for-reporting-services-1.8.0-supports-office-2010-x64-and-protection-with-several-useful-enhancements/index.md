We are happy to release Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services v1.8.0. We have included some general features such as workbook and worksheet protection.  The Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services client component now supports Office 2010 x64. We have also carried out optimization work to improve the overall performance of Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services and its modules.

In this version we have also fixed a number of internal bugs and included several new enhancements, for example, the Herder background color bug, a hide column issue, the row merged algorithm module, a page break issue, hyperlink and bookmark links bugs, the row algorithm module, the Excel 2007 (data only) output bug and more.

There are some other enhancements and users’ fixes too. Download it today from: [http://www.aspose.com/community/files/52/ssrs-rendering-extensions/aspose.cells-for-reporting-services/entry353793.aspx][1]
