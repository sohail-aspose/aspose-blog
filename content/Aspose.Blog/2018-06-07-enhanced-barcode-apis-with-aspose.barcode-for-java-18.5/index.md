[![Aspose.BarCode for Java][1]](https://products.aspose.com/barcode/java) Aspose.BarCode for Java 18.5 is available for [download][2] now. This is a maintenance release whereby we have resolved some incurring issues in API. Some of the functionality which were marked as obsolete have also been removed from the API in this release.

## Issues Resolved

It was reported that **GetCustomSizeBarCodeImage** method is not working properly. It is discarding the check digit in the resultant image of barcode. After investigation this issue has been resolved. Now barcode generation process is working properly. Furthermore while we were investigating some issue internally, it was found that an incorrect/fake **MicrE13B** barcode detected by the API. This issue has also been resolved.
