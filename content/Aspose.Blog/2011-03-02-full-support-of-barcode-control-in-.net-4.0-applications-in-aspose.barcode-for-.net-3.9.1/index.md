We have recently released Aspose.BarCode for .NET 3.9.1 hotfix which fixes the issues in adding the BarCode control in Windows Forms .NET 4.0 project in Visual Studio 2010. With this hotfix, the control can now be used and easily customized according to your needs. You also need to change the target platform to ".NET 4.0" if it is set to ".NET 4.0 Client Profile".
