[![Aspose.Diagram for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/06/aspose-Diagram-for-net_100.png)Today, we are pleased to announce the Aspose.Diagram for .NET 5.1.0 release  (formerly known as the Aspose APIs for Microsoft Office Visio formats). We enhanced this to retrieve diagram headers and footers in a more convenient way. Besides above new enhancement, we also bring improvements in exporting Visio diagrams to any other supported formats. It's a continuous activity to chase upgrades in Microsoft Office Visio and dealing with the most complex diagrams.

## Retrieving Headers and Footers

Users can manage headers and footers using our rich Aspose.Diagram APIs. In some specific cases, APIs was not able to preserve headers and footers when saving in PDF file format. We have fixed such issues in this enhancement.

## Convert Visio Diagrams

Visio diagrams can hold much more information, so it is possible in Aspose APIs to export a Visio diagram for use in another application. We're including fixes of the converting feature almost in the each release, its the big area to work with many file formats. So these fixes improve Aspose APIs, quality, performance and customization levels.

In the recent release version, we have improved export areas regarding VSDX to HTML, VSD to PDF, VSD to PNG and VSDX to PDF. Please check a list of fixed issues below:

*   Fixed: VSDX to HTML conversion, circular shape Fill color is changed.
    
*   Fixed: VSDX to HTML conversion, missing textfield at the top right corner.
    
*   Fixed: Shape is missing from the output HTML format.
    
*   Fixed: VSD to PDF conversion, border of the shapes are not preserved properly.
    
*   Fixed: VSD to PNG conversion, extra white space below the actual diagram.
    
*   Fixed: VSDX to PDF conversion, original shape style is not preserved.
    
*   Fixed: VSDX to PDF conversion, incorrect line breaks in the shape text.
    
*   Fixed: NullReferenceException occurred when getting page object by its name.
    
*   Fixed: VSDX to PDF conversion, all the shapes turn into black color.
