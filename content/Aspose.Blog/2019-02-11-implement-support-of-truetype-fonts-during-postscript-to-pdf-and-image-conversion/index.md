We are pleased to announce latest release of [Aspose.EPS][1] API for both .NET and Java Platforms. In this January release, limitations related to rendering of TrueType Fonts have been removed. There were some limitations in earlier version(s) of the API where Type1 Fonts were used to be rendered as outlines instead of text resulting the restrictions that users cannot perform text search operations over obtained PDF documents. However, those restrictions are removed in latest version of the API and conversion of TrueType Fonts in PS to PDF and Images has been implemented. Furthermore, PS to PDF Conversion Engine is also optimized in this release of the API. In case you are planning to upgrade the API to latest version, you can download it using following links:
