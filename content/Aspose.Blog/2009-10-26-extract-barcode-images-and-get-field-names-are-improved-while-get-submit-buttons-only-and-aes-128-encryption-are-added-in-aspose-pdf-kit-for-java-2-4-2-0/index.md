Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java 2.4.2 is released. With this latest version of Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java, you can now get submit button names. The feature to get field names is improved as well. We have also enhanced the feature of extracting barcode images from a PDF file, so that it will not fail or produce black images while extracting barcode images. Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java also supports AES-128 encryption.  
  
You can see the list of new features and fixes and download the latest version from the [Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java download section][1].
