We have published the new version of Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET. In Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET 4.0.0, we have improved some main features of the component and fixed various bugs to make it more convenient. PDF to image conversion feature is improved to produce better quality images from the existing PDF files without any trouble. The quality of the text and other contents in the output images is enhanced. Text and image extraction is another major feature of the component and in this version we have made some improvements in the PdfExtractor class as well. Text can be easily extracted from the copy protected PDF files.  
  
We have introduced a new [CompressionType][1] enumeration to support various compression types while [converting a PDF file to TIFF images][2]. Our team has also put the effort in improving the text placement using [PdfFileMend][3] class. This improvement will help place the text on the correct coordinates. PdfViewer class is also enhanced so that the PDF pages are decoded to images properly.  
  
We have also made some changes in the API and corrected the class and method names related to Bookmarks functionality. If you're already using bookmark feature in your code, you need to recompile the code using the latest changes.  
  
You can see the complete list of changes and download the latest version from the [Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET download section][4].
