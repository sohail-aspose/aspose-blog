We at Aspose are pleased to announce the September revision of Aspose.XPS for .NET 18.9 which is available for download over NuGet Gallery. In this latest release of the API, new features and enhancements have been included. With the latest version of the API, cross-package operations can be performed now e.g. add/insert an element from another document (XPS package), assign a property value created in the context of another document, create elements/property values based on file resources created in the context of another document, add/insert a page from another document. Since the work related to the Print Ticket feature has been under process, new support about this feature has been added to the API. A feature to get a job/document/page print ticket object and link it to another job/document/page has been introduced. You can download the latest version of the API from the link given below:
