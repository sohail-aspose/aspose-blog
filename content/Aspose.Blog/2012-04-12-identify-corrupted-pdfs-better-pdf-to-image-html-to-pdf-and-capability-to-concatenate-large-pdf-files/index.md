We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.PDF for .NET 6.9.0][1]. In this release, we have addressed around 76 items which include some great new features, enhancements to existing product features, and resolution of reported issues. One of the new features introduced in this release is the ability to check if the source PDF file is correct or corrupted. This feature has been in great demand by many customers that have faced problems during PDF concatenation. If any of the source files are corrupted the whole process gets disturbed and interrupted.

We also have introduced a feature that lets you add an image field type to an existing PDF document. Some customers wanted to be able to apply justified alignment to a multiline text field, so we have made it possible with the help of FormFieldFacade.AlignJustified value. CheckBoxes can have the values Check, Circle, Diamond, Square, and Cross when selected inside the PDF form.

Our development team has worked hard to stabilize and improve the HTML to PDF, PDF to image, PDF to HTML, and PDF to XPS conversions as well as filling form fields, merging PDF files, extracting text, and many other features. This release has also been tested in a multi-threaded environment and works great.
