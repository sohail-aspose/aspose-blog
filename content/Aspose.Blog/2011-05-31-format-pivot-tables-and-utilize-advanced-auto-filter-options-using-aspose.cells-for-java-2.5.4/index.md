![Aspose.Cells icon][1]

We have released the Aspose.Cells for Java v2.5.4. In this version, we have added support for several advanced auto-filter types: MultipleFilter, DynamicFilter and IconFilter. Now, you can easily format a whole pivot table, toggle a pivot field’s items  between hidden/shown.  Moreover, you can specify axis’ properties as “Automatic” for Charts. The formula calculation engine is also enhanced, it now supports EOMONTH formula.

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
