We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Tasks for Java 18.3][1]. This release brings enhancements to API functionality by introducing new features. Specifically, it provides support for renumbering WBS Codes of tasks in a project and eliminates gaps between tasks list and page footer while rendering project data. For a detailed note on what is new and fixed, please visit the [Release Notes][2] page of API documentation.

## Renumber WBS Codes in Projects using Java

This release of Aspose.Tasks for Java lets you [renumber the WBS codes][3] associated with tasks like Microsoft Project’s “Renumber” function. You can renumber all or selected WBS codes of tasks in a project as shown in the following sample code.

## Eliminating Gaps between Tasks List and Page Footer

The rendering capabilities of project data to various formats is one of the powerful features of Aspose.Tasks for Java API.  We have further improved this functionality by providing the feature of [reducing gap][4] between project’s tasks list and footer information in output. This improves the visualization of project’s rendered information in the output. The setReduceFooterGap property of SaveOptions class can be used to achieve this as shown in the following code sample.

## Get Page Count for Specific Dates

This release also introduces an enhancement for getting number of pages based on specified Start and End dates. This feature can be used to get [specific page count][5] for specified dates even during conversion to various output formats.
