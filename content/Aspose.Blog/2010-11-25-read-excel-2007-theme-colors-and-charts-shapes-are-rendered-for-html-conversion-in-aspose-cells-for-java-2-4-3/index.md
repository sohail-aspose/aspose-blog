We have published Aspose.Cells for Java v2.4.3 for the users.

In this version, we have supported reading Excel 2007 Theme colors. While saving files to HTML format, the charts/shapes are rendered now. We have also made enhancements for the following features:

*   Chart to Image
*   Direct Excel to PDF feature

There are some other fixes and enhancements too.
