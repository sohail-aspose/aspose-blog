We just released Aspose.BarCode for .NET 3.0.2 hotfix, that contains improved recognition algorithms for 2d barcode images and scanned documents. This will increase the probability of reading barcodes from scanned images and documents (formats supported by Aspose). This fix also contains fixes for the issues reported by customers.
