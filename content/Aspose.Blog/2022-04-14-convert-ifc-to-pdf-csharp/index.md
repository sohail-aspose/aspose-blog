[IFC][1] files are Industry Foundation Classes files that are used for enhancing compatibility properties between different software applications. These files are usually used to create a model of a facility or a building as they can contain different shapes, materials as well as spatial elements. Sometimes you might need to convert an IFC file to [PDF][2] format because only a limited number of applications support viewing the IFC files. Accordingly, this article covers how to convert an IFC file to PDF format programmatically in C#.
