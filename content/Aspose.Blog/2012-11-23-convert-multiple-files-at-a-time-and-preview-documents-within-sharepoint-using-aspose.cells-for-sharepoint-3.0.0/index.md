[![Aspose.Cells logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/05/aspose.cells-logo2.jpg)We are happy to announce the long awaited release of Aspose.Cells for SharePoint 3.0.0. In this release, we have provided support for [converting multiple files at a time][2] and [previewing documents][3] within SharePoint. We've also improved file format conversion, for example, we have added more file formats for the conversion (XLSB, MHtml, XPS, TIFF, SVG, and DIF). We have also done some optimization work to improve the overall performance of the product in this release.
