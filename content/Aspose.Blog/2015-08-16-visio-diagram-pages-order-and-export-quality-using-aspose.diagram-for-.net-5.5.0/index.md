[![Aspose.Diagram for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/06/aspose-Diagram-for-net_100.png)We're pleased to announce the new release version of Aspose.Diagram for .NET 5.5.0. This blog post explains fixed defects and their stronger impact on the relationship between clients and us because we believe in strong client relationships. We have improved Visio drawing page structure specially while exporting to any other supported file format. Besides that, we have improved export quality to preserve complete content, including shapes, fill color, data elements, and the picture and avoid messed form of the shapes.

## Correct Order of Visio Diagram Pages

We had received many tricky Visio drawings time to time from the clients, having the problem of incorrect order of pages in the resultant file formats. We gathered all these samples and solved the problem generically for at least all those clients. We're hopeful in tremendously decreasing the frequency of all such bugs. The most involved export areas are as follows: VSD to VDX, VSD to PDF and VSD to HTML conversions.

## Preserve Shapes, Fill Color, Data Elements and Images

In the recent release version, we have improved its export quality in many expects. In previous, clients were facing issues like preserving a shape partitioning, absence of the shape fill color, getting a blank or corrupt image, unable to retrieve Solution XML elements and the messed form of the shapes. All those issues are now fixed. Please check a list of fixed issues below:

*   Fixed: \[SolutionXML elements\] Can't read XmlValue properly.
    
*   Fixed: VSD to XPS conversion, the arrow lines are not much clear.
    
*   Fixed: VSDX to XPS / SVG conversion, the arrow lines are not much clear.
    
*   Fixed: VSDX to PNG / XPS conversion, the shapes fill color is not preserved.
    
*   Fixed: VDX to PNG conversion, getting a blank image or corrupt image.
    
*   Fixed: VSD to VDX conversion, shapes turn into messes form.
    
*   Fixed: VSD to PDF / HTML conversion, the shapes color is not preserved.
