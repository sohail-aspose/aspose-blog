![Aspose.BarCode logo][1]

We have been working on Aspose.BarCode for Java to make its features set closer to Aspose.BarCode for .NET and we have now completed that work. All new features and bug fixes that make it into the latest release of .NET are now also available in the Java version. So from now on, whether your platform is .NET or Java, you will get the latest updates, features and bug fixes.

The previous version of Aspose.BarCode for Java was 2.7 but as you might have seen, the current version is 4.4. We allowed this dramatic version increase to reflect that the feature sets are now the same.

## Impact of Changes

There are a few API changes and your existing code needs to be updated to use the latest version. We had to make these changes to  keep the class and method names in Aspose.BarCode for Java and Aspose.BarCode for .NET similar. The changes are easy to make if you use the auto-completion feature of the IDE. Most necessary changes can also be done using the Find/Replace All feature of the editor. The Programmer's Guide has been updated to to incorporate the changes. But still, if you find any issue, please contact us in forums and we will be happy to assist you.

There were some old pending bugs in Aspose.BarCode for Java which were also fixed in this version. For download and release notes, please visit [http://www.aspose.com/community/files/72/java-components/aspose.barcode-for-java/default.aspx][2].

**Edit \[14th February, 2012\]:** Aspose.BarCode for Java is ported automatically from Aspose.BarCode for .NET using a magical code porting tool which we use internally.
