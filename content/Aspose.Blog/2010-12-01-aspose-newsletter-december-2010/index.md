#### End of the Year and a Very Special Offer

At Aspose we don't believe in standing still. We've nurtured a strong sense of continual improvement in our business and our products. The literally thousands of features and enhancements that we've packed into our products this year stands testimony to this. We’ve also registered over 100,000 users at Aspose.com making 2010 the year we became the World’s largest file format community.

We're hard at work putting the finishing touches to Aspose.Words version 10 which brings all the features of the .NET version to the Java version of the product. We're planning to deliver this early in 2011. We're also working on a few new exciting product announcements that we'll introduce over the course of the next few months - stay tuned!

This year we've also introduced a brand new range of SharePoint products. Aspose.Words for SharePoint, Aspose.Cells for SharePoint and Aspose.Slides for SharePoint deliver the power and flexibility of our document conversion technology to the end users of your SharePoint solutions. It’s never been easier to give your users the documents they need in the formats they want them in.
