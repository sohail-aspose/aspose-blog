[Aspose.PDF for Reporting Services][1] is one of the widely used and stable export component for SQL Reporting Services for the conversion of .RDL reports to PDF as well as XPS file formats. Recently, we received many requests from our customers for the provision of export option to EPUB format.

## Export RDL to EPUB Format

EPUB (short for electronic publication) is a free and open e-book standard from the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). Files have the extension .epub and we have been receiving lots of requests from our customers regarding the support for this format. So now apart from current features of rendering .RDL file to PDF and XPS format, you can use the same component to generate the output in EPUB format. The options becomes available in both ReportServer as well as in Visual Studio when using Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services in local mode.
