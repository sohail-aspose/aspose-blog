FBX files are commonly used to exchange information between different 3D file manipulation applications. In certain situations, you might need to **convert [FBX][1] to [RVM][2] or RVM to FBX files**. RVM files are useful because they include information about Texture, Geometry, Geometry, and labels of objects. Please refer to the following sections to explore the conversion scenarios.

## Convert FBX to RVM Programmatically using Java {#section2}

You can convert FBX to RVM files with the steps below:

1.  Load the input FBX file with [Scene][9] class.
2.  Instantiate an object of [RvmSaveOptions][10] class.
3.  Save output RVM file.

The code sample below explains how to convert an FBX file to an RVM file programmatically using Java:

## Convert RVM to FBX Programmatically with Java {#section3}

You need to follow the below steps to convert a RVM file to a FBX file:

1.  Load input RVM file using [Scene][11] class.
2.  Declare a [FbxSaveOptions][12] class object.
3.  Save output FBX file.

The following code snippet shows how to convert a RVM file to a FBX file programmatically in Java:
