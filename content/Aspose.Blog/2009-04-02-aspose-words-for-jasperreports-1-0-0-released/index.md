The Aspose.Words family is growing again. We are happy to announce our brand new product, [Aspose.Words for JasperReports][1]!

Aspose.Words for JasperReports is the only known solution on the market that makes possible exporting reports from JasperReports and JasperServer to editable Microsoft Word documents with the highest degree of precision. JasperReports and JasperServer do not have built-in abilities to export reports as Microsoft Word documents; the only exception is the RTF format that uses positioned items such as textboxes, which makes the generated documents very hard to edit. Using Aspose.Words for JasperReports, you will get access to such formats as DOC, DOCX, HTML, and TXT. The documents produced by Aspose.Words for JasperReports are easy to edit in Microsoft Word.

Aspose.Words for JasperReports is built on top of Aspose.Words for Java, the world-class library for server-side Microsoft Word documents processing. This is our second solution with such architecture. The other one is [Aspose.Words for Reporting Services][2] which is based on Aspose.Words for .NET.

Let's overview some major features of the product.

**Export formats**

Aspose.Words for JasperReports 1.0.0 supports the following export formats:

*   DOC - Microsoft Word document
*   DOCX - Office Open XML (OOXML) document
*   HTML - Web page
*   TXT - Plain text

More export formats will be available in the future.

**High Fidelity to Report Design**

Aspose.Words for JasperReports exports reports as Microsoft Word documents in such a way that they look identical to reports exported by the built-in exporters of JasperReports.

**Easy and Lightweight Deployment**

Aspose.Words for JasperReports is provided as a single JAR file that can be easily integrated with JasperReports or JasperServer.

To install Aspose.Words for JasperReports, simply copy the JAR file to a correct folder. To integrate with JasperServer you will also need to edit a JasperServer configuration file.

**Editable Documents**

Aspose.Words for JasperReports exports flow layout documents. This means they consist of “normal” paragraphs, tables and images that are easy to further edit in Microsoft Word, if necessary. The built in JasperReports RTF exporter produces documents consisting of positioned text frames and that makes further editing hard.

Aspose.Words for JasperReports uses a number of techniques to make the resulting document as easy to edit as possible. For example, tables in JasperReports are normally built from a bunch of text elements. Aspose.Words for JasperReports attempts to export those as normal, editable Microsoft Word tables.
