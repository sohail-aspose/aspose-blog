We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for JasperReports 17.9.

This release has been built on the basis of latest Aspose.Slides for Java 17.9 API. Aspose.Slides for Java 17.9 is enriched with some new features including improved rendering support for HTML including support for slide notes and preserving original fonts. Moreover, the text, chart and other shapes rendering support has also been improved in this release. The improved rendering will thus be helpful in generating presentation files from JasperReports.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for JasperReports 17.9 Release Notes][2] for further reference.
