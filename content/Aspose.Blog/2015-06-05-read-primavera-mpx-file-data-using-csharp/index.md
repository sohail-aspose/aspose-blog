We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Tasks for .NET 8.4.1][1]. This month’s release includes new features in addition to the API improvements as a result of bug fixes. Please visit our product download page for having an idea about what is new and fixed. If you have any query or inquiries related to the API, you can reach us over [Aspose.Tasks forum][2] for assistance.

This month’s release of Aspose.Tasks includes a new feature of reading Primavera MPX file format and adding extended attributes to Resource Assignments.

## Read Primavera MPX File Format

Aspose.Tasks already facilitate importing and exporting Project data from Primavera file formats. In our last month’s release, we introduced the feature of exporting project data to Primavera MPX format. This month’s release now further enhances this capability by providing the capability of reading Primavera MPX file data. What this means is that the API now supports reading Calendar, Resource, Task, Extended Attributes, Resource Assignments and Recurring Task information from the MPX file. Once imported, the data can be exported to any other formats such as MPP, XML, and other Primavera formats.

## Add Extended Attributes to Resource Assignments

With this month’s release, Aspose.Tasks for .NET now supports adding extended attributes to Resource Assignments of a project. This feature has been implemented for all versions of Microsoft Project (MSP) i.e. 2003, 2007, 2010, and 2013. The structural implementation of this feature was already in place, but these were not visible in the output file.

## Other Improvements

This month’s release includes further improvements as a result of a number of bug fixes. These include:

*   Project Reading Exceptions while reading certain project files
*   Exception raised while reading slack values in scientific notation
*   Functional issue with calculation for working with 24-hour calendar
*   Issue with adding calendar to project
