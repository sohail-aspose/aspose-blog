![Aspose.Cells icon][1]

We are happy to release Aspose.Cells for .NET v7.0.2. We have made several enhancements and fixed a number of user issues/bugs. Moreover, we have removed some obsolete methods for the Sheet-to-Image feature.

In this version, you can get the document properties for an encrypted XLS file without even knowing its password. We have made enhancements for Smart Markers feature: now you can group data in some complex scenarios where you also need to place dynamic rows for Sub-Totals, Totals and Grand Totals in between the sections of data. The GridDesktop control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET now supports shapes while loading Excel files.

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
