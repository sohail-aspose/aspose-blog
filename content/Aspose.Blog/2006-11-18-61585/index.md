I was looking at Office OpenXML White Paper recently and came across this paragraph of text:

_“High Fidelity Migration” describes how OpenXML meets the over-arching goal to preserve the information, including the original creator’s full intent, in existing and new documents._

It is very interesting because we thought we were the first apply the term "High Fidelity" to document processing. This happended about a year ago, end of 2005. It was a term that we intended to use for marketing purposes to describe new upcoming features in Aspose.Words. But now since someone else put it out, I guess we just have to mention our art.

At first, we came up with this term to describe the upcoming rendering capability of Aspose.Words:

*   Aspose.Words High Fidelity Rendering

Then a little later (mid 2006), we decided to extend this term to the way Aspose.Words converts between Microsoft Word formats (DOC, RTF and WordprocessingML):

*   Aspose.Words High Fidelity Export (or Conversion)

In our usage, High Fidelity means High Fidelity to Microsoft Word. Basically, if Aspose.Words does something with High Fidelity, it means it does something a lot like Microsoft Word does it.

For example, Aspose.Words High Fidelity Export to RTF means that an RTF file produced by Aspose.Words will be almost indistinguishable from a file produced by Microsoft Word for the same document.

That's all for now. Just remember, when you see "High Fidelity Something" related to document processing, think of Aspose.Words.
