## Aspose for Apache POI

Project [Aspose for Apache POI][4] shows how different functionalities can be achieved using Aspose Java APIs in comparison with Apache POI. In addition, Aspose has many more features than Apache POI to fulfil developer requirements. To highlight some of these enhanced features of Aspose APIs, following are few modules of examples showing features that are only available in Aspose.Words but missing in Apache POI WP (HWPF + XWPF).

*   [Missing Features of Apache POI SS available in Aspose.Cells][5]
*   [Missing Features of Apache POI SL available in Aspose.Slides][6]
*   [Missing Features of Apache POI WP available in Aspose.Words][7]
*   [Missing Features of Apache POI HSMF available in Aspose.Email][8]

After this release [Aspose.Words vs Apache POI WP][9], [Aspose.Slides vs Apache POI SL][10], [Aspose.Cells vs Apache POI SS][11], [Aspose.Email vs Apache POI HSMF][12] and [Missing Features of Apache POI WP in Aspose.Words][13] are available in Aspose Project Wizard from version 2.3 and onwards.

With this integration you don't need to manually download the [Aspose Java APIs code comparison examples with Apache POI framework][14] as they are now available through the plugin's Aspose New Example wizard within NetBeans IDE.
