Currently it supports the version 1.9, but we are working hard to enhance it and increase the support till latest version. With every new release, we are working on improving the API in terms of stability while fixing bugs reported in earlier release versions and also enhancing its capabilities while introducing new features.

The HTML file creation and manipulation are among the salient features of this API and there has been a scenario where API encountered an issue while substituting fonts during conversion. Therefore in this release, we have primarily worked on fixing this scenario and API has been stabled to catered such scenarios.
