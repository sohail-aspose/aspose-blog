We have 9100 unit tests in Aspose.Words for Java and 923 of them pass right now.

On the surface itÂ might look ugly that 90% of the tests fail. But there seems to be a few simple problems (stubs instead of code in some of the most basic platform abstraction methods such as formatting a double into a string). I am sure fixing those will get hundreds and thousands of unit tests to pass.
