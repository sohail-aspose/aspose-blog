We have published an interesting demo project that you might find useful.

This demo project uses Aspose.Cells for .NET, Aspose.Words for .NET and about 1200 lines of custom code to convert Microsoft Excel workbooks to Microsoft Word documents.

Using this project, you can convert from any load format supported by Aspose.Cells (XLS, OOXML XLSX, SpreadsheetML, CSV and tab delimited) to any save format supported by Aspose.Words (DOC, OOXML DOCX, RTF, WordprocessingML, HTML, PDF).
