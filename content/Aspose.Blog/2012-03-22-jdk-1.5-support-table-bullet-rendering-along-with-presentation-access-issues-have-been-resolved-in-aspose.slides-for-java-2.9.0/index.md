We're please to announce Aspose.Slides for Java 2.9.0. This release is compliant with JDK 1.5 and adds support for picture bullets in PPTX presentations.  However, this is mainly a maintenance release that fixes a number of different issues. We have resolved issues to do with presentation access, as well as table rendering issues and issues with missing border lines relating to saved and cloned presentations.
