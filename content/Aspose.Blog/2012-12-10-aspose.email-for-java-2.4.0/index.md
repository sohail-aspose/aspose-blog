[![Aspose.Email for Java][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/02/aspose.email-logo120.jpg)

We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Email for Java 2.4.0. This monthâ€™s release addresses a number of important bug fixes related to PST operations that were observed while copying bulk of MapiMessages from one PST to another; and extraction of MapiCalendar items from a PST. In addition, issues with recurrence rules of Appointmnet/Meeting objects have now been fixed as well in this new version.

To get further details about what's new & fixed, read the release notes by visiting the [Aspose.Email for Java][2] release page.
