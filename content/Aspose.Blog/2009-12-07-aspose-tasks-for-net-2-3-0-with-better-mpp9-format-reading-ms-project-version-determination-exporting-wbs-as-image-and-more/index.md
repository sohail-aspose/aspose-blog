Dear Customers,

We are pleased to announce the new release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET 2.3.0. This release fixes issues with reading MPP / XML files created with MS Project 2003, determining MS Project version with which project file is saved and simplifies adding resources to a project. In addition, this release also introduces a new feature, that is, exporting WBS as an image.
