[Aspose][1], a file formats API provider, has decided to add Xamarin.Android to the platforms that they support. The first product to be launched on this platform is Aspose’s most popular product, Aspose.Words. The name of this product will be **Aspose.Words for Xamarin.Android**. This new Aspose.Words for Xamarin.Android API will be released within next couple of months. This new product is all about bringing stunning features of Aspose.Words for .NET to the **Xamarin.Android** platform that makes it possible to do **native Android development in C#**, with either Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio.

Aspose.Words for Xamarin.Android will be the first product of its kind on the API market. It will make it possible for Android developers to open, convert and combine Microsoft Word and other popular word processing file formats from within their native Android applications.

Android developers will be able to offer their users **high-fidelity file conversions** to and from DOC, OOXML, RTF, WordprocessingML, HTML, MHTML, TXT and OpenDocument formats. **Full programmatic access through a rich API** to all Word document elements and formatting allows to create, modify, extract, copy, split, join, and replace document content. Android developers will be able to convert whole documents or pages to PDF or XPS inside their native Android apps. All with high fidelity - exactly like Microsoft Word® would have done it. Android developers will be able to easily generate documents or reports from scratch or by filling templates with data from data sources or business objects.

Developers, who used [Aspose.Words for .NET][2] in their projects before, will find names and behavior of many classes, methods and properties familiar in this new Aspose.Words for Xamarin.Android API. I would also like to mention that **Aspose.Words for .NET** is a highly trusted API and native Android developers will get the same feeling in the new Aspose.Words for Xamarin.Android API. Although, it has less features (a few limitations) at the moment but Aspose's ultimate goal is to port all features of Aspose.Words for .NET to Aspose.Words for Xamarin.Android API. Aspose also ensures that the learning curve is minimal because they borrow best practices from the Xamarin Design Guidelines and provide a balance of easy usage vs detailed document element manipulation.
