Aspose.Report for .NET 2.3.0 has been released. This release includes the improved DataPoint constructor for Gantt charts.

Query parsing features are also improved in this release. In previous releases, ParseSQLStatement and ParseOrderByStatement methods were not parsing the complex queries (queries containing ‘from’ keyword in the field names). Now these members can parse all types of queries. This release also includes some important bug fixes.
