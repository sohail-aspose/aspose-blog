We are pleased to share the release announcement of [Aspose.Slides for SharePoint][1] 18.6.

This release has been developed based on Aspose.Slides for .NET 18.6, whereby we have provided improved MSO charts management support. The export to PDF and slide thumbnails has also been improved and this improved rendering support will contribute in overall API performance for exporting presentations to different formats including images, PDF and XPS when using Aspose.Slides for SharePoint.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for SharePoint 18.6 Release Notes][2] for further reference.
