## Convert STL to FBX File Programmatically using Java {#section2}

You can convert an STL file to an FBX file with the below steps:

1.  Initialize an object of [Scene][11] class.
2.  Load input STL file with [Open][12] method.
3.  Specify the output format for the FBX file.
4.  Save output FBX file.

The following code explains how to convert an STL file to an FBX file programmatically using Java:

## Convert STL to glTF GLB File Programmatically in Java {#section3}

You can convert an STL file to a binary glTF GLB file with the following steps:

1.  Load input STL file using [Scene][13] class.
2.  Specify output file format as GLB.
3.  Save output GLB file.

The code below shows how to convert an STL file to a Binary glTF GLB file programmatically using Java:
