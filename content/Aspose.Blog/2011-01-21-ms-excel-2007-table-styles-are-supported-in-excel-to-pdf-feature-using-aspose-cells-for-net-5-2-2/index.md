We have released the Aspose.Cells for .NET v5.2.2 for the users.

In this version, we have supported to export MS Excel 2007 Table’s styles while generating PDF files from Excel spreadsheets. We have also enhanced the internal modules for reading and writing ODS files. For the web control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET, we have upgraded the control’s base .htc files to JavaScript files for better productivity.

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
