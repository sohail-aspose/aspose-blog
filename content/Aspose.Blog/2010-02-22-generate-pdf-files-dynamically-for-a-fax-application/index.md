## About Abraxas Medical Solutions



{{< figure align=center src="images/Abraxas_Medical_Solutions_use_Aspose.Pdf_for_.NET_create_PDFs_dynamically_for-2.png" alt="Abraxas Medical Solutions logo">}}


Abraxas Medical Solutions provides software applications for electronic medical records (EMR) and practice management (PM) using a single Microsoft-SQL Â© database. Along with its state-of-the-art software application, Abraxas offers implementation and training services to automate the entire workflow of the medical office for more efficient and profitable practice.

Abraxas EMR has been designed with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), making it very easy for the medical providers and the office staff to adapt to. In addition, Abraxas EMR can be populated with a clinical knowledge base that is specific to the medical specialty or specialties of your practice. The clinical knowledge base can be edited as needed, enabling customization of EMR software to suit client needs.

Abraxas EMR software solution has also earned CCHIT 08 Certification for Ambulatory EHR certification from CCHIT (Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology), currently the only set of standards for the electronic health record (EHR) industry. This means that Abraxas EMR has been rigorously tested and shown to meet the EMR certification requirements in terms of functionality, security, and interoperability.

For maximum efficiency, Abraxas software comes with its own faxing solution as a standard feature eliminating the cost and the hassle of integrating with a third-party faxing solution.

## Problem

Faxing the documents has been among the main functions that were heavily used by our clients to instantly communicate with referring physicians, payers, pharmacies, and patients from the application. Our goal was to eliminate a print driver, improve the faxing functionality and support new platforms.

We needed to create a PDF dynamically without using a print driver for a C# Windows application. The PDF was then faxed to a list of recipients from the application.

## Solution

By using [Aspose.PDF for .NET][1] and [Aspose.Words for .NET][2], we created a single PDF that combined a fax header, body and selected image files such as a JPG, TIFF, BMP, and GIF. The application interfaced with Microsoft Fax to send faxes out using internal and external modems. And the resultant PDF was faxed to a list of recipients. Unifying all document types that could be used within the application and producing uniform PDF files to feed to Microsoft Fax was a key factor for compatibility across different operating systems.

## Experience

Time to learn about [Aspose.PDF for .NET][3] and the implementation of the solution was very quick. Implementation was simple and straightforward. With wide industry use, some members of our development team had prior experience using different [Aspose components][4] which helped shorten our implementation cycle.

Troubleshooting was very efficient and quick due to the reliability and robustness of [Aspose][5].

## Next Steps

We will definitely consider using Aspose to implement our future requirements. Our application automates the entire workflow of medical practice and there is a constant flow of future enhancements requests. We will consider using [Aspose solutions][6] in many of these projects. These areas include email communication, patient portal, medical devices interface, and other regulatory requirements in the medical field.

## Summary

We liked using the [demo version][7] to test the product before we purchased it and we liked how quickly we could understand and implement the solution.
