Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java 2.4.3 is released. This latest version of Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java provides a better encryption mechanism. PdfViewer and PdfConverter classes are improved. Multi-line text support with wordwrap is also added in this version. Some work has been done on form field flattening feature to enhance the capability.  
  
Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java creates temporary files while processing a PDF document to extract images. We have introduced a new class named Settings, which provides two methods to set or get the folder for storing temporary files. These methods are setTemporaryDirectory and getTemporaryDirectory. We have also introduced a new method in PdfExtractor class named close, which allows you to clean the temporary files after the work is done.  
  
You can see the list of new features and fixes and download the latest version from the [Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java download section][1].
