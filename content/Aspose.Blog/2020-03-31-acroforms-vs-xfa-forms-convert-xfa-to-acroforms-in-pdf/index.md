![Convert XFA to AcroForms][1]

## AcroForms vs XFA Forms

[AcroForms][2] are the fillable forms that are used to integrate the form fields in PDF documents. It was the initial forms technology adopted by Adobe for the PDF documents starting from PDF 1.2 specification. AcroForms allow adding the form fields as an overlay to collect the data from the end-users or anyone using the document.

Later, Adobe adopted the XML-based [XFA][3] forms (XML Forms Architecture) as part of the PDF 1.5 specification after acquiring Accelio (a service provider). XFA used the capabilities of the XML for developing the e-forms in PDF documents. However, despite being a newer e-form technology as compared to AcroForms, XFA has a few limitations which include:

*   lack of JavaScript support with various PDF objects,
*   XFA forms can be created with Adobe LiveCycle Forms Designer only,
*   compatibility issues with the AcroForms,
*   lack of an automatic conversion from AcroForms to XFA,
*   limited accessibility as compared to AcroForms,
*   requires developer skills to build the forms,
*   and etc.

Since AcroForms technology is considered to be more accessible and easy to use, the upcoming section shows how to perform **XFA to AcroForms** conversion in PDF programmatically using **C#** and **Java**.
