We are happy to announce the first release of a free add-in that allows you to convert any document opened in Microsoft Word 2007 to EPUB.

To download go to [http://www.aspose.com/community/files/69/free-microsoft-office-add-ins/aspose.words-for-microsoft-word/default.aspx][1].

Below are summarys from the user's guide that is included in the installer.

# Introduction

**Aspose.Words for Microsoft Word** is a free utility that allows converting any document opened in Microsoft Word 2007 to the EPUB format. Microsoft Word 2007 can load documents in many formats including DOC, DOCX, RTF, HTML, ODT, etc and you can now easily convert them all to EPUB using _Aspose.Words for Microsoft Word_.

# About the EPUB format

EPUB is an XML-based distribution format for eBooks that is rapidly gaining adoption by publishers and distributors. EPUB is an open standard supported by the [International Digital Publishing Forum][2] (IDPF) organization. See also the [Wikipedia article][3].

# To Save as EPUB

After you install _Aspose.Words for Microsoft Word_, the EPUB format will be listed in the Save As dialog. Saving to EPUB is just as simple as saving to any other file format available in Microsoft Word.

*   Open any document in Microsoft Word.
*   From the Save As menu select “Aspose.Words – EPUB (\*.epub)”, and then click Save.

**You can save any document from Microsoft Word to EPUB using _Aspose.Words for Microsoft Word_.**

**An EPUB document created by _Aspose.Words for Microsoft Word_ is displayed in Adobe Digital Editions.**

# How it Works

_Aspose.Words for Microsoft Word_ is implemented using the following two technologies:

*   [Aspose.Words for .NET][4]

*   [Microsoft Word 2007 SP2 Open XML Format External Converter][5].aspx)

When installed, _Aspose.Words for Microsoft Word_ registers itself as an Open XML Format External Converter and this makes Microsoft Word show EPUB as a new file format in the Save As dialog box.

When you select to save as EPUB, the following happens:

*   Microsoft Word saves the document in the OpenXML WordprocessingML format and sends it to _Aspose.Words for Microsoft Word_.
*   _Aspose.Words for Microsoft Words_ is built on top of **Aspose.Words for .NET**, a class library for document conversion, generation, reporting and rendering. _Aspose.Words for .NET_ loads the OpenXML document and converts it to the EPUB format.

# System Requirements

To install and run _Aspose.Words for Microsoft Word_ make sure you have the following software installed:

*   .NET Framework 2.0 or newer
*   Microsoft Office Word 2007 Service Pack 2

# Technical Support

We provide free unlimited technical support in the [Aspose.Words Support Forum][6]. Please allow up to 24 hours for reply due to time zone differences.
