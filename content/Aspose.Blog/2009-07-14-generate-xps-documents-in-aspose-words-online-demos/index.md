We have updated [Aspose.Words][1] Online Demos to Aspose.Words 6.5 to show conversion of documents to Microsoft XML Paper Specification (XPS).  

[Dinner Invitation][2] is one of the demos. Click on the Demo tab, click on the XPS option and click Submit. The generated XPS document will be sent to your browser. If you have an XPS viewer installed, it will show.  

N.B. XPS (and PDF, rendering and printing) are available in Aspose.Words for .NET only at the moment. Will be available in Aspose.Words for Java later in 2009.
