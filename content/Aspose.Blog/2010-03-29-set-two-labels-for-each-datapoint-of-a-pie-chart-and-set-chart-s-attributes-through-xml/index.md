Aspose.Report for .NET 2.5.0 has been released. This release supports setting many attributes of different chart elements through XML. Previously, users were able to create charts through XML but some attributes were not supported in the XML which are supported now.

This release also supports setting two labels for each data point of a Pie chart. Previously, only one label for each data point was supported.

Behavior of series.DefaultDataPoint.Color has also been changed in this release. Before this release, DefaultDataPoint.Color property was setting the color of each data point. Now, you can add a data point with different color even if DefaultDataPoint.Color is set.
