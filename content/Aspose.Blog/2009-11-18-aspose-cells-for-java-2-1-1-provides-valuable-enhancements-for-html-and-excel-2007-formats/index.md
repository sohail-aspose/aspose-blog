We have released Aspose.Cells for Java v2.1.1 for the users.

In the new version, there are some new enhancements regarding HTML format; the component imports spreadsheets in HTML format: it exports images to customized destination; it handles images when saving HTML file; it improves performance by cutting off string values that cross multiple cells. 

The component can read Document Properties in Excel 2007 formats. It imports/exports array formulas for Excel 2007 files. You can apply style to a cell using your desired attributes using StyleFlag object. You can update certain controlsâ€™ attributes at runtime. The rows would be shifted accordingly when inserting/deleting range of cells.

The performance is optimized for certain objects and operations. For example, the performance of reading/writing large Excel files is enhanced. The performance of autoFitRows/Columns operation is also optimized. Moreover, we have improved the internal model for different chart objects and markers.

There are some other fixes and enhancements too.
