This 2.1.0 release and latest 2.1.1 hot fix are merged with latest stable version of Aspose.Slides for .Net.  
Also there are several issues were fixed:  

*   FitShapeToText didn't work in previous versions so it was possible that long text blocks didn't fit to calculated rectangles.
*   Text could be cut off in case it doesn't fit to a rectangle and CanGrow property set to false.
*   No text background for summary and some other fields.
*   Bold, Italic and Underlined fonts wasn't rendered properly in some cases.
*   More accurate rendering of table and matrix cells and borders.
*   Size of a slide equal to the page size in a report now.
