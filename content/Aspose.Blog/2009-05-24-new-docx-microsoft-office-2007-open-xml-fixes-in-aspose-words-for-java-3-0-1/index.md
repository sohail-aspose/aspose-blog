The recently released Aspose.Words for Java 3.0.1 includes two critical DOCX bug fixes:

1.  Images resized during DOC->DOCX->DOC roundtrip under some European locales that used comma as decimal symbol.
    
2.  Microsoft Word 2007 SP2 reports “file was created using a newer version of Microsoft Word”.
