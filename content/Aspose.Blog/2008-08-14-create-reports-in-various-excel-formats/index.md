## About Ubisoft



{{< figure align=center src="images/18836845_10155161880077293_679591653296443540_o.jpg" alt="Ubisoft logo">}}


A leading creator, publisher, and distributor of video games, [Ubisoft][1] has grown considerably over the past two decades as a result of our strategy centered on the creation of strong brands, in-house development, and a vast global distribution network. This has allowed us to not only produce innovative, high-quality titles but also acquire an in-depth knowledge of our consumers and their expectations.

To sustain our company growth in such a competitive market, we implement a new common e-recruitment tool across sites and aim to improve our recruitment practices among our existing HRMS systems and tools.

## Requirements Scenario

Ubisoft HRIS strongly relies on Microsoft technologies (.NET Framework, IIS web application server, etc.). The implemented solution should be based on third party components supporting this technology, easy to use, and flexible enough to meet Ubisoft subsidiaries' diverse business needs and recruitment volumes.

Our web-based HR applications should be secure (to ensure data integrity and confidentiality), scalable and support globalization/localization (a wide scope of languages are used among the company). Our high expectations tend to improve efficiency, reduce maintenance costs, and ensure that Ubisoft technology is not only stable but is on the cutting edge.

The use cases identified during our analysis require a component that allows :

*   To manage Excel Spreadsheets (reports generation in various formats .xls, .xlsx, .csv, …) and to handle Excel features like advanced formatting, charts, pivot tables
*   To [generate Pdf documents][2]
*   To [manipulate Word documents][3] (creation, parsing, etc.)

Finally, this should be a stand-alone component not requiring any software (such as Microsoft Office) to be installed on the system hosting our applications.

## Solution Implementation

After evaluating and benchmarking various solutions Ubisoft came to the conclusion that the best choice was [Aspose.Total for .NET][4].

[Aspose.Total for .NET][5] includes a wide set of components that allow us to manipulate Excel, Word and Pdf documents and fulfill all our business needs.

The quality of the documentation including tutorials, articles, and API References allowed us to easily and efficiently implement our solution.
