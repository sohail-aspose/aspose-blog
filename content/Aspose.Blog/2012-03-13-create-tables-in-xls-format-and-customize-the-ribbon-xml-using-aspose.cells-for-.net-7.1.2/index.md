We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Cells for .NET 7.1.2. This monthâ€™s release provides extensive support for tables in XLS format. [You can now customize the Ribbon XML][2]. There are some enhancements made for pivot table module. We have improved the performance for PDF rendering and loading large workbooks. Both the load and export processes are now fast enough to suit your performance needs.
