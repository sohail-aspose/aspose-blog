## Clone and then Connect Visio Shapes by Connection Indexes

Aspose.Diagram API has support of cloning shapes, and then connecting them by connection indexes. The recent version 18.4 has improved the accuracy without API changes. The Copy method of the Shape instance, takes a shape instance to clone, and then ConnectShapesViaConnectorIndex method exposed by the Page class can be used to connect shapes by connection indexes. Please refer to the documented code examples as follows:

*   [Copy a Visio Shape to another Shape instance (C#)][3]
*   [Use Connection indexes to connect shapes (C#)][4]
*   [Copy a Visio Shape to another Shape instance (Java)][5]
