## STL to FBX or glTF GLB File Converter – C# API Installation {#section1}

[Aspose.3D for .NET][8] API can be used to create, edit, or manipulate STL, FBX, glTF, GLB, and several other [file formats][9]. You can download the DLL file from the [New Releases][10] section, or use the following [NuGet][11] installation command in Visual Studio IDE:

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.3D
```

## Convert STL to FBX File with C# {#section2}

You can convert an STL file to an FBX file with the following steps:

1.  Declare an instance of [Scene][12] class.
2.  Load the source STL file with the [Open][13] method.
3.  Set the output type for the FBX file.
4.  Save the output FBX file.

The following code snippet shows how to convert an STL file to an FBX file with C#:

## Convert STL to glTF GLB File Programmatically in C# {#section3}

You can convert an STL file to GLB (binary glTF) file with the below steps:

1.  Load input STL file with [Scene][14] class.
2.  Set the output file format as GLB.
3.  Save output GLB file.

The code snippet below explains how to convert an STL file to a GLB Binary glTF file programmatically with C#:
