Aspose.BarCode for Java 18.6 is available for [download][1] now. This is a maintenance release whereby we have resolved some incurring issues in API.

## Issues Resolved

It was reported that Aspose.BarCode is not recognizing the QR barcode successfully from TIFF images. After investigation, this issue has been resolved. Now API recognizes the QR barcode from TIFF images properly. Furthermore, while an internal investigation was in progress, it was found that metered licensing is not working correctly. This issue has also been resolved.
