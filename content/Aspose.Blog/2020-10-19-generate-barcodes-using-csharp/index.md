Barcodes are used to visually represent the data in a machine-readable form. Most often, barcodes appear to be a means of a product's identification. Various types of barcodes are used in different scenarios such as Code128, QR, Datamatrix, Aztec, etc. In this article, you will learn **how to generate the barcodes in C#**. Furthermore, you will see how to customize the appearance of a barcode.

## C# Barcode API - Free Download {#CSharp-Barcode-Generator-API}

[Aspose.BarCode for .NET][6] is a powerful barcode generator and scanner API. It lets you generate and read a wide range of barcode symbologies, including but not limited to:

*   Code128
*   Code11
*   Code39
*   QR
*   Datamatrix
*   EAN13
*   EAN8
*   ITF14
*   PDF417
*   andÂ [more][7].

You can [download][8] the API for free or get it installed within your .NET application using [NuGet][9].

```

## How to Generate a Barcode using C# {#Generate-Barcode-using-CSharp}

The following are the steps to generate a barcode using Aspose.BarCode for .NET.

*   First, create an object of [BarcodeGenerator][10] class and specify the barcode's type and text in its constructor.
*   Set barcode's features such as resolution and etc.
*   Finally, generate barcode using [BarcodeGenerator.Save(String)][11] method.

The following code sample shows how to generate a barcode using C#.

## How to Generate a QR Barcode using C# {#Generate-QR-Barcode-using-CSharp}

You can generate other types of barcodes in a similar way. For the demonstration, let's generate a QR barcode. The following are the steps to generate a QR barcode.

*   Create an object of [BarcodeGenerator][12] class and specify the barcode's type as _EncodeTypes.QR_.
*   Generate barcode using [BarcodeGenerator.Save(String)][13] method.

The following code sample shows how to generate a QR barcode using C#.

## Customize the Appearance of a Barcode in C# {#Customize-the-Appearance-of-a-Barcode-in-CSharp}

You can also customize the appearance of the barcode. For example, you can change its font, forecolor, background color, text color, and etc. The following are the steps to customize a barcode using Aspose.BarCode for .NET.

*   First, create an instance of [BarcodeGenerator][14] class.
*   Set the barcode's appearance using [BarcodeGenerator.Parameters][15] properties i.e. _BarcodeGenerator.Parameters.BackColor_.
*   Finally, generate barcode using [BarcodeGenerator.Save(String)][16] method.

The following code sample shows how to generate a customized Aztec barcode using C#.

## Add Caption in Barcodes using C# {#Add-Caption-in-Barcode-using-CSharp}

You might have seen barcodes with a caption above or below the barcode image. These captions can be used to display additional information about the barcode itself. Aspose.BarCode for .NET also allows you to add a caption below, above, or on both sides of the barcode. The following are the steps to add a caption.

*   First, create an object of [BarcodeGenerator][17] class.
*   Set the barcode's text and type in the constructor of _BarcodeGenerator_.
*   Set caption using [CaptionAbove][18] or [CaptionBelow][19] properties.
*   Finally, save the barcode using [BarcodeGenerator.Save(String)][20] method.

The following code sample shows how to add caption in a barcode using C#.

## Conclusion

In this article, you have learned how to generate barcodes programmatically using C#. In addition, you have seen how to customize a barcode by modifying its appearance. You can explore more about the C# barcode generator API using [documentation][21].
