## About Red Gate



{{< figure align=center src="images/0-5.png" alt="Redgate company logo">}}


[Red Gate][1] needed a simple solution for sharing management reports in a portable format with internal and external advisers. Converting spreadsheets and presentations to PDF was taking up valuable time. To streamline the process, Red Gate implemented [Aspose.Total for SharePoint][2], giving all their users the ability to [convert Microsoft Office documents to PDF][3] with a click of button.

Red Gate chose [Aspose.Total for SharePoint][4] because it was easy to use, worked from the start and had [better licensing options][5] than the alternatives.

Red Gate has been producing software since 1999. The company creates products that are technologically challenging and fulfilling to the people who work on them, but also work well for their customers. Red Gate have a deep understanding of their customers’ needs and believes that a good piece of software starts and ends with the person who is going to use it.

Red Gate’s product portfolio includes products for  SQL server development, database administration, Oracle development, .NET development and Exchange administration. We have achieved Best Companies accreditation and The Sunday Times Best Small Companies to Work for awards every year since 2007.

## The Challenge

The management team at Red Gate is supported by a group of external advisers. To be able to give insightful advice, these advisers need access to the same information as the management team at Red Gate. All management information is posted to a secure area of a SharePoint intranet that can be accessed from inside or outside the company.

Inside the company, the Red Gate IT team has control over what platforms and software versions are used by their users. This means that it is easy to share information internally by uploading the original report documents: all interested parties are likely to have access to a version of the software that it was created with. For external parties, this is not the case. The best way to share documents with external agents in a safe and portable way is to [convert them to PDF files][7]. By [converting Excel spreadsheets][8], [PowerPoint presentations][9] or [Word documents to PDF][10], the document authors got confident that they can be read by anyone with Adobe Reader installed.

Initially, the report authors or their assistants converted files to PDF manually and published them. It was not a good use of time. Something had to change.

## The Project

Red Gate’s ideal solution was one where authors could upload a file and [convert it to PDF on SharePoint][11]. That solution ensures that a centralised PDF converter is used, saving effort and license cost. PDF conversion is not a standard feature in SharePoint websites so Red Gate had to find a product that would allow them to perform this action. They started looking for a SharePoint component that would meet their needs.

## Finding a Solution

Red Gate looked at a number of different solutions before deciding on [Aspose.Total for SharePoint][12]. Their trials showed that SharePoint components can be difficult to install - some need several attempts before they work - and tricky to configure. The type of component they were looking for also came with a number of different licensing and pricing options.

Red Gate decided to use [Aspose.Total for SharePoint][13] because it had better licensing, more features and was less expensive than the options. It also installed first time and was ready to use immediately.

A positive side effect of the component is that one-click conversion to PDF is now available to all users of the SharePoint system. PDF has quickly become a popular file format within Red Gate: portable and non-editable it is perfect for safely sharing information within and outside of the company.

## Getting Support

When Red Gate started the project, they needed a component that would work on SharePoint 2010 and not all of the [Aspose components for SharePoint][14] did. Aspose are continually developing the products so before the project was complete that had changed. All [Aspose.Total for SharePoint][15] now support SharePoint 2010.

## Next Steps

[Aspose.Total for SharePoint][16] may allow Red Gate to make their newsletter and other publications easier to read on the go. EPUB is an increasingly popular format and Aspose’s support for it allows companies to publish books, magazines and newsletters to their community.
