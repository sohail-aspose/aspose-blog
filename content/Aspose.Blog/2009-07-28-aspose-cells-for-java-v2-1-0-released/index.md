We have released Aspose.Cells for Java v2.1.0 for the users.

In this version, we have enhanced ODS (Open Document Spreadsheet) support and introduced several new features including Hyperlink, Page Setup options, Group outline, Conditional formatting, Data validation, AutoFilter, Page Break, PrintTitleRows/Columns, Shapes and Chart. We have also provided some features regarding MS Excel 2007 file format(s), e.g Inserting Pictures, Adding Charts. The users can now update controls (CheckBox, ComboBox, ListBox, RadioButton, ScrollBar, Spinner) via the linked cells, and vice versa.

We have provided some more features. For example, the users can now access Shape’s properties: Name, ZOrderPosition. The Subtotals feature is now supported for some users' demand. We have added support to calculate Hyperlink function/formula. The users can delete user defined Names in the worksheets. Good news for the users who are using XLS2PDF feature as we now support hyperlinks for the conversion. Moreover, the users can extract Ole Objects in the template excel file for their need. There are some bug fixes and other enhancements too.
