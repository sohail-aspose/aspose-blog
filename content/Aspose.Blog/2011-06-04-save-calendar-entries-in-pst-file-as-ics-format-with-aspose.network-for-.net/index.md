We are pleased to announce the release of a new version of Aspose.Network for .NET. In this version we added support for exporting calendar items in PST file to ICS format. Saving calendar items as MSG was already available, now with ICS export, you can add or synchronize these calendar items with any other application that understands the common ICS format.

We also added some new methods in our ExchangeWebServiceClient class and provided bug fixes. To view release notes and download, please visit [https://downloads.aspose.com/email/net][1].
