## HTML to Plain Text Converter in C# {#section1}

You can convert HTML to Plain Text with [Aspose.HTML for .NET][7] API. It can easily be configured in .NET Framework-based environment using the following [NuGet][8] installation command:

```

```

## Convert HTML to Text File using INodeIterator in C# {#section2}

Aspose.HTML for .NET API is based on DOM (Document Object Model) so you can iterate through different nodes of the API using the INodeIterator interface. Likewise, it gives you the control to define a NodeFilter and override methods for filtering contents. You can ignore the style, script, or any other element in the HTML file to pick only the text string out of it. Below are the steps to convert HTML to Plain TXT File using C#:

1.  Read input HTML file
2.  Initialize the instance of node iterator
3.  Create [INodeIterator][9] instance
4.  Check for Style Filter
5.  Read Node value in a string
6.  Write Text contents of HTML as TXT file

The code below shows how to convert HTML to Plain Text file using C#:

We have learned how to convert HTML to Text using INodeIterator. Likewise, there are several other approaches to achieve these requirements. You can create a custom method to extract text, or work with TextContent property as explained in the steps below:

1.  Load input HTML document
2.  Define a user-defined method
3.  Check each [NodeType][10] to see if it’s an element node or text node

2.  Read the text contents of the HTML format
3.  Write the TXT file with extracted text from webpage
