We have released Aspose.Cells for .NET v5.1.0 for the users.  
  
In this release, we have added support for Smart Tags. We have also provided support for PDF/A compliance in Excel to PDF feature. There is another enhancement in Smart Markers providing support for images now. You can directly apply Cellâ€™s gradient fills and themes in XLS files. Moreover, the component would render pattern fill effects in the generated PDF file. We have also improved the overall performance and quality of the generated PDF files.

The web control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET provides support for converting hierarchical custom collections to Datasets which contain relations. Using the windows control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET, you can now utilize its Scroll event. It is also possible to exclude hidden cells to get SUM of the selected ranges data using overloaded Worksheet.SumSelectedRanges method.

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
