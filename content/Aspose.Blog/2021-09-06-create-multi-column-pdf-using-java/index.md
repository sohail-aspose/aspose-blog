## Create a Multi-Column PDF using Java {#Create-a-Multi-column-PDF}

Aspose.PDF for Java makes it quite easier for you to create a multi-column PDF file. The following are the steps to achieve this.

*   First, create a new [Document][6] object.
*   Then, set the page margins using [Document.getPageInfo().getMargin().setLeft()][7] and [Document.getPageInfo().getMargin().setRight()][8] methods.
*   Add a new page in the PDF using [Document.getPages().add()][9] method and get its reference into a [Page][10] object.
*   Create a new [Graph][11] object and add it to the paragraph collection using [Page.getParagraphs().add()][12] method.
*   Create a new [Line][13] and add it to the [Graph.getShapes()][14] collection.
*   Add heading text to the page using [Page.getParagraphs().add()][15] method.
*   Create a new [FloatingBox][16] and specify the number of columns, column spacing, and column width.
*   Create another [Graph][17] object.
*   Add a new [Line][18] to the [Graph.getShapes()][19] collection.
*   Add Graph to the [FloatingBox.getParagraphs()][20] collection.
*   Create a new [TextFragment][21] and add it to [FloatingBox.getParagraphs()][22] collection.
*   Add [FloatingBox][23] to the page using [Page.getParagraphs().add()][24] method.
*   Finally, save the PDF file using [Document.save(string)][25] method.
