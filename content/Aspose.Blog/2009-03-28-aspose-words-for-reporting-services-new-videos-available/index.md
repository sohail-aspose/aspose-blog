Just wanted to announce that we have recently released three new videos demonstrating various Aspose.Words for Reporting Services features. The videos are:

*   [Use AWRS in Report Viewer in Local Mode][1] - shows how to add Microsoft Word export formats directly from the Microsoft ReportViewer control working in local mode.
*   [Generate a Report from the Report Designer][2] - demonstrates how to export a report to a Microsoft Word document from Business Intelligence Development Studio.
*   [What is High Fidelity? Report in different formats looks the same][3] - demonstrates that a report exported by Aspose.Words for Reporting Services in different Microsoft Word formats looks exactly the same.

There are more cool videos to come. Stay tuned!
