Aspose.Tasks for .NET 5.3.0 has been released.

With this release, Aspose.Tasks for .NET supports reading and writing tasks, resources, task links, calendar, resource assignments, outline codes and extended attributes data in Microsoft Project 2013 XML format. Thus, Aspose.Tasks now supports reading and writing MSP 2013 in both MPP and XML format.

This month's release has also fixed a number of bugs related to Microsoft Project 2003 and 2010 MPP formats such as calendar data update, rendering contents of a cell without truncation,  and some regression issues.
