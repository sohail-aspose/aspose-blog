[](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/07/highres_440634499.jpeg)The [Tauranga Web Meetup][1] is for professionals working in the web industry: designers, developers, analysts, business owners, project managers, DBAs, Sys Admins.

These meetups provide an opportunity to find out what other web people in Tauranga are up to and share knowledge and ideas.

The group has semi regular monthly meetings which cover a variety of topics and end with a round of beer afterwards

Currently they are talking about application performance with an open floor so anyone can come an contribute their knowledge.

Aspose loves getting behind local user groups which is why we are sponsoring the next meet up:
