We have published Aspose.Cells for .NET v5.1.4 for the users.

In this version, we have supported encrypting PDF documents. You may utilize API from the newly added namespace: Aspose.Cells.Rendering.PdfSecurity. The GridWeb control has re-organized its API structure now. The GridDesktop control allows you to import/export Excel files with Auto-Filters.

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
