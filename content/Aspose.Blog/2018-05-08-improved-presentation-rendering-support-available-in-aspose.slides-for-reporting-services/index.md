We are pleased to share the release announcement for [Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services][1] 18.4

This release has been developed based on Aspose.Slides for .NET 18.4, whereby we have provided support for MSO 2016 charts along with improved SVG rendering support for shapes like charts, tables and auto shapes. This improved support in Aspose.Slides for .NET will achieve better rendering of SQL Server reports when exporting to PowerPoint or other formats using Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 18.4 Release Notes][2] for further reference.
