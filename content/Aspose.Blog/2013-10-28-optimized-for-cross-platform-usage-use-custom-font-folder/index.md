We are pleased to announce the release of the latest hotfix for [Aspose.PDF for Java 4.3.1][1]. This version is optimized for cross-platform usage and works great with Windows, Linux, and Solaris operating systems.

We have also introduced a feature for setting the path to the custom fonts folder when manipulating PDF documents. The following two methods are introduced to accomplish this requirement.

*   **Document.getLocalFontPath()** - Shows the system folder in which our project will look for fonts.
*   **Document.setLocalFontPath(String)** - Sets the path to the custom font folder.

Please visit the following link to find out what's new and what's fixed in [Aspose.PDF for Java 4.3.1][2].
