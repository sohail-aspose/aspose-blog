We released merged Aspose.Pdf for .NET last week. I have already discussed that how we have improved the 'PDF Engine' to provide better results, along with introducing the DOM API for processing PDF files. In this post, I'm going to share that how we have improved the documentation.

# Starting Point

The documentation is mainly divided into four sections: Product Information, Programmer's Guide, Knowledge Base, and Aspose.Pdf for .NET API Reference. The product information section contains getting started guide as usual, including product overview, installation and licensing information. However, you might have noticed that features section contains three page. In fact, each page shows the features of a particular part of the new merged Aspose.Pdf for .NET: new DOM API features, Aspose.Pdf.Generator features, Aspose.Pdf.Facade Features.

# Programmer's Guide

Programmer's guide section is also divided into three subsections just like the features section. Each programmer's guide subsection contains the help topics and samples relating to the particular part of the component. The samples belonging to a specific area of functionality are grouped together.

For example, if you want to add text in a PDF file while creating a new PDF from scratch, you can simply go to the 'Working with Text' subsection of the Aspose.Pdf.Generator section. And if you want to search or edit text in an existing PDF file, you can go to the 'Working with Text' subsection of the Aspose.Pdf section or 'Working with Text' subsection of the Aspose.Pdf.Facades section. As we have already discussed in detail, now you have got two options to edit PDF files: either use legacy interface, previously supported with Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET (Aspose.Pdf.Facades) or the new DOM API (Aspose.Pdf).

The other areas included in Aspose.Pdf (DOM API) and Aspose.Pdf.Facades sections are images (DOM API, Facades), Stamps and Watermarks (DOM API, Facades), Document (DOM API, Facades), Pages ([DOM API][1], Facades), Attachments (DOM API, Facades), Bookmarks (DOM API, Facades), Annotations (DOM API, Facades), Forms (DOM API, [Facades][2], Links and Actions ([DOM API][3], Facades), Security and Signatures (DOM API, Facades). However, if you want to work with operators that is only supported with DOM API and printing is supported only with the Facades at the moment.

# Knowledge Base and API Reference

Lastly, the Aspose.Pdf for .NET API Reference provides a list of all the namespaces and classes in the component, while Knowledge Base contains technical articles, migration tips and topics on using Aspose.Pdf for .NET in other programming languages.

# At Your Service!

We have tried to provide samples for most of the common scenarios and we'll keep adding more topics so that you would be able to use the component easily to be more productive. If you need any further assistance, you may post the query in [Aspose.Pdf forum][4], and we'll be glad to help you out.
