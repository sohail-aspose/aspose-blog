[![][1]](https://www.aspose.com/products/tasks/net)We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Tasks for .NET 17.3.0][2]. This month’s release is sort of maintenance release that contains fixes to bugs reported by our valued customers with the last month’s version. For a complete list of what is new and fixed, please visit the [release notes][3] section of Aspose.Tasks for .NET documentation.

# Improvements

The bug fixes included in this month’s release affect a number of functionality areas of the API in terms of improvement. We have fixed issues related to reading and writing MPP files that resulted in exceptions while saving the file.

We have also fixed issues related to the formula value calculations while working with date time formula fields of a project. The recalculation issues have been fixed for these fields including DateAdd, DateDiff and DatePart.

We have also improved the recalculation implementations for both MPP and XML file formats. This includes bug fixes that resulted in unexpected output in some cases. Fixing such issues has improved the API behavior in terms of expected output for specified criterion.
