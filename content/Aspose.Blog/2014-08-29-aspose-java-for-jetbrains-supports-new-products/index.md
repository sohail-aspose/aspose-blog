We are pleased to announce **release 1.2** for the **Aspose for Java JetBrains** plugin to support Aspose's new product family. With this release, the plugin adds support for Aspose.Tasks and Aspose.Diagram.

### Aspose.Tasks for Java

[![Aspose.Tasks for Java logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/12/aspose-Tasks-for-Java_100.png)Aspose.Tasks for Java is a project management API that enables Java application developers to provide Microsoft Project® document manipulation capability in their applications – all without using Microsoft Project®. With this powerful API, developers can control various stages of project management, such as project planning, definition and tracking.

### Aspose.Diagram for Java

[![Aspose.Diagram for Java logo][2]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/aspose_diagram-for-java-e1401178596961.png)Aspose.Diagram for Java is a Non-Graphical and well-structured API that allows developers to load, create, save and manipulate Microsoft Visio drawings within a Java application without using Microsoft Visio. It provides better performance and is easier to use to manipulate diagrams and convert files than Microsoft Office Automation.

Support for **Aspose.Tasks for Java** and **Aspose.Diagram for Java** has been added to the **Aspose Project Wizard** and **Aspose Example** modules of the plugin, so now you don't have to download the API JARs and examples code for **Aspose.Tasks** and **Aspose.Diagram** manually and copy them to the project. This is now supported by the plugin in the IDE native flow.
