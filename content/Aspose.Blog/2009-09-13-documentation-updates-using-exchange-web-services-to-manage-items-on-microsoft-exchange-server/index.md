We introduced a new class ExchangeWebServiceClient in Aspose.Network for .NET v4.8. This class is included in Aspose.Network.Exchange namespace and uses Exchange Web Services internally to connect and manage emails on Microsoft Exchange Server. Since, Exchange Web Services were introduced in Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, this class would work with Exchange 2007 and later versions.
