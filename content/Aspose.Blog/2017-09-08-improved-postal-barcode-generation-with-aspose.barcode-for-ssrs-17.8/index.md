We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.BarCode for Reporting Services 17.8. The major development in this release is to generate postal barcode with specified height. Before this release, it was not possible to set the height of bars for Postal barcodes like postnet, AustraliaPost etc.

## Other Improvements

This release also fixes some exceptions that were reported by our customers. Following is the list:

*   Process of generating EAN14 coded barcode has been improved.
*   Functionality of yDimension property has been enhanced. It is now working for 2D barcodes e.g. CodablockF.
