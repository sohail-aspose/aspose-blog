Project [Aspose for Java for Docx4j][1] shows how different tasks can be performed using Aspose for Java APIs in comparison with Docx4j for spreadsheets, particularly Xlsx4j. The project also covers the features that are only available in Aspose APIs but not in Xlsx4j for Microsoft Excel and Open Office spreadsheets.

Some of the examples are available to [download][2] [![][3]](https://downloads.aspose.com/total) to give you a better idea of how the APIs work. Many more detailed examples are available at Aspose Docs.
