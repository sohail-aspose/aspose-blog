[![Aspose.Email for .NET][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/07/aspose-Email-for-net_100.png)Aspose .NET Gmail Sync for DNN is an open source module from [Aspose][2] that links your DNN users to Google or Gmail contacts without requiring any other software. It uses the powerful features of [Aspose.Email for .NET][3] to allow you to easily sync your Gmail contacts and DNN users. The contact details from Gmail and DNN user profiles are smartly mapped so that all the information associated with a DNN user or Gmail contact is migrated properly from one system to the other.

This initial version of the module is enriched with the following cool features to make the sync process effective, simple and easy to use.

*   Google/Gmail server credentials are encrypted and saved in the database so that you don’t have to enter them every time you use the module.
*   Sync all or selected Gmail contacts to DNN and vice versa.
*   Option to select one or more DNN roles when performing Gmail to DNN sync.
*   Existence of every contact/user in the destination system is checked before migration to make sure that the sync does not create duplicate records.
*   The contacts migrated to Gmail are put in Other Contacts group so that you can verify and move only required ones to My Contacts.
*   A brief summary of the sync process is shown upon completion.
