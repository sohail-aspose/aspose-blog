We are pleased to share that Aspose.Email for Java 3.7.0 has been released with a number of enhancements and bug fixes.

Aspose.Email API has been field proven for manipulating different types of email messages and working with appointments. Adding as well as retrieving attachments information from messages has been part of the API since the very beginning; however, the same was missing till yet for appointments/calendar files. We are glad to share that Aspose.Email API now supports adding, retrieving and extracting attachments from calendar files, as detailed in our [Adding and retrieving attachments information][1] article.

Microsoft Outlook allows setting reminders to calendar items which alerts the user about the upcoming event before the specified time. With this month’s release, Aspose.Email for Java now provides the same feature for setting [display][2] as well as audio reminders for calendar items.

This month's release also includes an Examples dashboard with the zipped archive of Aspose.Email for Java which fetches the programmer's guide examples from Github for getting started with code samples quickly. In addition, this month’s release also includes a number of bug fixes for the reported issues by our valued customers which further adds value to the overall functionality of the API.
