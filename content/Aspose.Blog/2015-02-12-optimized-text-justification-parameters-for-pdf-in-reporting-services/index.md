Text Justification is one of the salient features of [Aspose.PDF for Reporting Services][1] which distinguishes it from the native PDF rendering feature of SQL Reporting Services. Recently we discovered an issue where the TextJustification feature caused some issues when some parameters were passed to the TextBox element. However, this issue has specifically been improved in the latest release.

Please get the download and start exploring the exciting new release of [Aspose.PDF for Reporting Services 3.1.0][2].
