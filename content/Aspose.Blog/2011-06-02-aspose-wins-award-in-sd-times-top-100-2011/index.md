**USA, Texas – June 1, 2011 –** [SD Times][1], the software development magazine, recognizes the innovation and leadership of companies, non-profit organizations, open source projects and other initiatives in their annual Top 100 awards. This year, Aspose was included in the Components category.

The SD Times 100 is not a product award but awards leadership in a variety of software development industry areas. Nominations are submitted by SD Times readers and editors and winners are selected by the SD Times editorial board. The editorial board considers each company's products and reputation and listens to the buzz around the company. They pick their top 100 after much research and debate. To reflect how companies cluster, categories are flexible and can change from year to year. Aspose has previously featured in the Components & Libraries category ([SD Times Top 100 2010][2] & [SD Times Top 100 2009][3].

This is the third year in a row that Aspose receives an SD Times Top 100 award. It is inspiring to be on the same list as household names such as Apple, Google and Microsoft. We hope that our attention to our customers' needs, ongoing innovation and hard work will continue to impress both our customers and the SD Times.

[You can find the full list of winners at the SD Times website][4].
