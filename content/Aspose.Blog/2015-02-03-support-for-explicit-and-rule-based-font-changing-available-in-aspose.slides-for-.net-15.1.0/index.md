[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for .NET 15.1.0. This is major maintenance release in which we have resolved certain issues incurring in the product.

## New Features

We have introduced support for replacing the fonts inside presentation. We have introduced support for both explicit and rule based font replacement inside presentation. More details about this feature are available in the article Managing Fonts inside Presentation.

## Resolved Issues

We have resolved the issues that appeared while accessing, saving and rendering presentation to PDF, HTML or slide thumbnails, which resulted in different exceptions like NullReference, ArgumentException, PptxReadException, ObjectReferenceException,and IndexOutOfRange in previous releases.

The rendering to PDF, slide thumbnail, HTML and SVG has been significantly improved by addressing areas of right to left language text, improper text, missing background, blank slides, missing WordArt, improper SmartArt and different charts elements rendering.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Refer to the article Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for .NET 15.1.0 for further reference.
