[![][1]](https://products.aspose.com/email)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Email for .NET 4.2.0 with a number of enhancements and bug fixes. With each new release, we are not only improving the API functionality by fixing issues reported by our customers, but also introducing new features, making it rich with features. You can download this latest version by visiting our [product download][2] page. In case of any further query or inquiry, please feel free to write to us on the [Aspose.Email forum][3]. You may also visit the online documentation to find out more about the public API and backwards incompatible changes.

## Creating Poll when Sending Message

Microsoft Outlook offers [voting options][4] that can be added to a new message. This allows the recipients to reply with their opinion by answering the poll. We are pleased to share that this month’s release now provides the capability of sending a message with voting options with options such as Yes, No, Maybe, etc. The FollowUpManager class object can be used to set the available options in a message which can then be sent using the Exchange Web Service (EWS) client. In addition, the message can be saved in Microsoft Outlook format as shown in the online documentation article Creating Voting Options using MapiMessage.

## Adding Attachments to Outlook Tasks

Creating, saving and reading Outlook tasks is already supported by Aspose.Email. The feature was further enhanced in the follow up versions where facility to read tasks and adding reminder information was added. This month’s release brings further improvement to this feature by allowing developers to add attachments to Outlook tasks.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

As always, we welcome feedback about any issues they encounter while using our API. This month’s release also fixes a number of bugs that affected the API functionality such as:

*   Issues related to messages addition to a PST.
*   Characters encoding issue while converting messages to other formats.
*   Attachments not being added properly.
*   Exceptions while loading certain messages and ImapClient initialization.
