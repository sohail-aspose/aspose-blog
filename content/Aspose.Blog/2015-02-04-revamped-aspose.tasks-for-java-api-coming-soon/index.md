We launched [Aspose.Tasks for .NET 8.0.0][1] last month which is a completely revamped version of the API. It introduced a complete different implementation while keeping the existing functionality intact. The purpose was to incorporate more improvements in the overall implementation of the API, make its usage more friendly and address certain implementation limitations that were otherwise difficult to handle.

# Aspose.Tasks for Java – Revamped Version

After the successful launch of Aspose.Tasks for .NET revamped API, we are now in process of launching the revamped version of Aspose.Tasks for Java. Ported from its equivalent .NET version, the Java API will contain the same improvements and modifications as were part of the .NET version.

Following are the main improvements that will be part of the revamped version of Asopse.Tasks for Java.

**Calculation modes:** The new API will provide manual as well as automatic recalculation modes similar to Microsoft Project (MSP). Manual mode will calculate only the necessary fields whereas automatic mode will recalculate everything.  This will eliminate the need to calling the recalculating methods manually and improve ease of use.

**Provision of Get/Set methods:** The new API provides general Get and Set methods for the _Project_, _Task_, _Resource_ and _Assignment_ classes. These methods will perform all calculations and free developers from worrying about performing recalculations. Moreover, the introduction of these methods will limit the quantity of publicly available properties and make the API easier to use.

We’ll be sharing more details about the revamped version in our final blog post as and when the revamped version of the API is available for release. In case of any inquiry in this regard, please feel free to contact us over [Aspose.Tasks forum][2].
