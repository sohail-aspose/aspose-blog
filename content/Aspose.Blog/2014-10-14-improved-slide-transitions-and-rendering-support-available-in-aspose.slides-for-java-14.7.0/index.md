[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-Java_100.png) We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Java 14.7.0. This is a maintenance release whereby we have addressed several issues that have been reported recently. The main focus has been to improve issues with access and saving files as well as slide transitions and rendering issues.

## New Features

We have introduced support for improved slide animations and transition effects in a presentation. We have also introduced support for cloning or serializing shapes within presentation slides. Now, it is possible to replicate shapes from a source slide by adding or inserting them into a target slide shape collection. For more details about shape cloning, please visit the documentation article Cloning Shapes in Slides.

## Resolved Issues

We have rectified issues pertaining to presentation accessing and saving to other formats which resulted in exceptions like NullReference, ArgumentException, IndexOutOfRange, StackOverFlow, TextFrameFormat and unsupported format exception using older product versions.

We have improved the API rendering performance in this release to a great extent in areas of charts, SmartArt, text and tables for generated slide thumbnails and exported PDFs.

We have addressed several rendering issues for charts and text frames involving text spilling out of shape, improper chart titles, missing images, missing text and improper chart rendering issues for exported PDF and generated thumbnails. The SmartArt rendering has also been improved and issues like missing or improperly rendered SmartArt shape in exported PDFs have also been rectified. We have enhanced the rendering support in this release for chart entities, other text elements and shapes inside generated thumbnails and PDF files. A list of resolved issues can be found inside product release notes for Aspose.Slides for Java 14.7.0 in the [download section][2].

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please visit the documentation article Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for Java 14.7.0 for further reference.
