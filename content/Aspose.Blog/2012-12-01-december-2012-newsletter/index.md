**Tip of the Month: Integrate Windows Azure Storage with Saaspose API** We have been continuously putting efforts in providing you the best experience of document manipulation in the cloud. You can now store your files in the cloud through [Windows Azure storage][1] and process your documents with the help of Saaspose file format APIs. We have previously introduced 3rd party platforms such as Amazon S3, Dropbox and Google Drive for integration with [Saaspose APIs][2] and we are working on more storage providers as per your feedback. The configuration of **Windows Azure storage** is simple and quick, and you can integrate it with Saaspose through a set of simple steps. You can upload your documents on Windows Azure storage and choose from a variety of features to manipulate the documents. Enjoy the flexibility to process your files from external storage provider with the required features. Keep tuned in to our [blog][3], and documentation.

**Use Saaspose SDK for Android Applications** Looking for Android applications for your document processing tasks? There is great news for **Android developers** across the globe to integrate feature-rich APIs in the applications to manipulate the documents. We are currently working on [Saaspose SDKs for Android][4] to facilitate the Android developers use a variety of document manipulation features in the applications. You can enhance the performance of your android applications by using **Saaspose REST APIs** and integrate the required features to manipulate different file formats in the cloud. You can add these [Saaspose APIs][5] in your Android applications easily and utilize the SDKs as per your requirements. For instance, you can **extract text** from documents, calculate formula in worksheets, **convert PDF to images, extract images** and slides from presentations and perform many such operations on the documents in your Android applications.
