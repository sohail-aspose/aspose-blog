The Phrygia Lab ([dokyun.pe.kr][1] is run by popular Microsoft MVP and blogger Kim Do-Kyun. Kim writes about software and programming tools and helps the Korean developer community stay up to date.  Kim is active in the .NET community and often holds talks at various user groups and events.

Aspose loves getting behind developers in the community which is why we are sponsoring Kim and his website. We recommend you go take a look at the latest he has to offer.
