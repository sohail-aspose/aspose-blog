This MEGA FIX release contains 91 fixes and enhancements.

Aspose.Words for Java has become more tolerating ofdocuments generated by third-party software or even to slightly corrupted documents. Such (real-world!) documents can contain strange things: image resolution that set to 0xFFFFFFFF (-1) or even Integer.MAX\_VALUE, open Xml tag without closing one, bookmark start field without bookmark end and vice versa and so on.

Besides this we added few new features to this release:

*   Full DrawingML support
*   HTML Image Export Customizations
*   Smart tags are now supported in DOC and DOCX
*   Access to Font Information and Panose
