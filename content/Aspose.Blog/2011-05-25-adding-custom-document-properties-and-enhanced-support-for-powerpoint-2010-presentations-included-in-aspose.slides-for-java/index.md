We like to share the announcement of new release of Aspose.Slides for Java 2.5.0. This is primarily a maintenance release in which resolution for many regression issues as well as exceptions being thrown during presentations access, PDFs generations and slide cloning for both PPT and PPTX. The issues pertaining to bullets rendering have also been remedied in this new release. The compulsion of using Aspose.Metafiles for Java has also been eradicated in this release and now, one will only need to add reference to Aspose.Metafiles for Java, if his presentation has WMF or EMF file contents. The compatibility support for working with PowerPoint 2010 presentations has also been enhanced. The support feature for getting the product version information and setting custom documents properties for the presentations have also been introduced in this new release.
