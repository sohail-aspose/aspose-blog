We released Aspose.Cells for .NET v4.8.2!

In this version, we have made enhancements for some features. Now you can read / write MS Excel 2007 Tables (List Objects). Moreover, when you copy a worksheet / workbook, the Tables (List Objects) would also be copied with it. For Smart Markers, we have supported to set IDataReader as a data source for the markers. You can export richly formatted text in the cells to html string value for your need. The formula calculation engine is further enhanced. You can update data from external referenced links now.

In the web grid of Aspose.Cells for .NET, we have supported some new formulas to the list. For example, the functions like ADDRESS, ROW, ROWS, COLUMN, COLUMNS, OFFSET and INDIRECT are supported now. We have also added some useful client-side events for the control.

There are some other fixes and enhancements too.
