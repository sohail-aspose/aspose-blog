We have just released Aspose.Network for .NET v4.3.0.0.

Outlook Message Files (\*.msg) reading and writing features has been improved by introducing more new fuctions, like SetMessageFlags and SetStringPropertyValue.

As long as Outlook featuers, Aspose.iCalendar is also integrated into Aspose.Network.
