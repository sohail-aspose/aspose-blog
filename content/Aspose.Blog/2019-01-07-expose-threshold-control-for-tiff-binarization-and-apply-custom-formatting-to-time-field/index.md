We are pleased to announce our next version [Aspose.Words for .NET 19.1][1]. This month’s release contains over 48 useful new features, enhancements and bug fixes. Please check the [**release notes**][2] to get an idea about all new features, enhancements and fixes made in this release. If you are planning to upgrade from older version of Aspose.Words to the current version, we would strongly suggest you to check the [Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes][3] section to know what APIs are changed so far.

## Added Feature to Apply Custom Formatting for Time Field

For Time field,  there is a difference between MS Word formatting and .NET/Windows formatting and also between different .NET Framework versions. So, we have added new feature in this version of Aspose.Words 19.1 to apply custom formatting to Time field. Now, user can format the Time field according to his requirement. For more detail, please read the following article

[How to Apply Custom Formatting to Time Field][4]

## Expose The Threshold Control for TIFF Binarization

We have added new property ThresholdForFloydSteinbergDithering in ImageSaveOptions class to control threshold for TIFF binarization. Please read the following article for more detail.
