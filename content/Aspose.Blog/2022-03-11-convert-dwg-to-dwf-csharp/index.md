[DWG][1] files are basically CAD drawings containing vector image data. Designers or architects frequently work with DWG format files. In some cases, you might need to convert a DWG file to a [DWF][2] format. In accordance with such requirements, this article covers how to convert a DWG to a DWF file programmatically in C#.

## DWG to DWF Conversion – .NET API Installation {#section1}

[Aspose.CAD for .NET][5] API supports creating, converting, or updating various CAD-related [file formats][6]. You can easily access the API by downloading its DLL file from the [Downloads][7] section or with the following [NuGet][8] command:

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.CAD
```

## Convert DWG to DWF Programmatically in .NET {#section2}

DWG to DWF file conversion is a simple process. You only need to make a few API calls in the following steps:

1.  Create an instance of the [Image][9] class to load the source DWG file.
2.  Cast the Image class object to [CadImage][10] type.
3.  Write the output DWF file with the [Save][11] method.

The following code sample elaborates how to convert a DWG file to a DWF file programmatically in C#:



## Explore More Features

You may take a look at several other features of the API where different chapters cover information about manipulating the CAD file formats in your applications. All of these features are covered under the API [documentation][12] section.

## Conclusion

In this article, you have learned how to convert DWG to DWF file format. You can scale this conversion process by taking the advantage of multi-threading. The API is written with managed code so it is thread-safe. However, to avoid any issues with the processing, you need to ensure each thread accesses a separate file. In case of any queries, please write to us at the [forum][13].
