We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.GIS for .NET 18.7][1]. This release introduces a new feature for supporting Geometry Markup Language (GML). It also provides support for reading data from ESRI File Geodatabase. For a complete list of what is new and fixed, please visit the [release notes][2] section of API documentation.

## Work with Geometry Markup Language (GML) Files in C#

Aspose.GIS for .NET now supports reading [Geometry Markup Language][3] (GML) file format. The API comes with the support of reading GML files with and without specifying Schema. At present, it doesn’t support creating or updating GML files. The following code sample shows working with GML file formats using Aspose.GIS API.
