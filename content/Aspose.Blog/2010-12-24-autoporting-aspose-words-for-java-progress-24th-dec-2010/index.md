There are only 679 unit tests failing in the autoported version of Aspose.Words for Java. This means almost 500 tests fixed since my last post just over a week ago.

Although the whole project is looking more like a finished product every day now, we are not releasing Aspose.Words for Java 10.0 in 2010. But we are not going to have a big slack for holidays either!

Have a great Christmas and Happy New Year from the Aspose.Words team!
