## HTML Splitter in C# – API Installation {#section1}

[Aspose.HTML for .NET][4] API supports creating or manipulating HTML webpages in your .NET Framework-based applications using C# programming language.

## Split HTML Webpage into Multiple Files in C# {#section2}

Aspose.HTML for .NET API has a rich set of features. It allows to copy content of loaded HTML document into another HTML document. However, since the HTML is not a fixed-layout format and does not has pages until we print it into particular device like PDF, DOCX, etc. So we cannot find any method or property which can split the content into pages like other fixed-layout formats. Therefore, you need to find the proper place to split the HTML and design the splitting logic accordingly.

In this example, we will be considering an example where you need to split an HTML webpage based on paragraph elements. Therefore, the following steps show how to split HTML webpage by paragraph:

1.  Load input HTML webpage
2.  Find all paragraph elements inside HTML document by using [Query Selector][7]
3.  Create an empty document to split [HTML][8] file
4.  Save output HTML files

The code snippet below further elaborates how to split HTML webpage into multiple files using C#:
