This release addresses several minor issues reported by customers. In particular, rendering of complex nested subreports was improved. Nested subreports containing tables often result in a deep hierarchy of nested tables in Microsoft Word documents. Starting with v1.0.4, the tables are "really" nested (containing each other) which fixes the layout and simplifies editing - for example, inner (child) tables are moved together with the outer (parent) table when positioning it in the document.

The next release will be more significant and will introduce MSI installer that allows to avoid manual installing and configuring Aspose.Words for Reporting Services.
