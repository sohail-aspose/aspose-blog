We are pleased to announce the August release of Aspose.3D API. We have enhanced the API to make it work across all platforms. Support for **Unity 3D** has been incorporated while considering repeated requests for this most awaited feature. This enables you to use the Aspose.3D API inside Unity3D to create and manipulate scenes as well as meshes, as per your requirements. Few other enhancements including the export of glTF files with Draco compression have also been made. The latest version also enables you to read COLLADA files in your application. You can use the following links to download Aspose.3D for .NET and Java APIs.
