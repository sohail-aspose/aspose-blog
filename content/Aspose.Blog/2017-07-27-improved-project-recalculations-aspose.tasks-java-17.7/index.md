*   Improved project data saving to XML format where the project calendars resulted in erroneous calendar entries
*   Issues with Timephased data writing to output MPP file which resulted in repeated entries in output XML file and some wrong work values in certain cases
*   Problems with actual start, percent complete and actual duration while saving project data to MPP using the API
*   Fixing of Out of memory errors while exporting project data to image
*   Issues related to preserving formulas while saving project data as MPP
