Aspose.Cells for .NET 7.5.1 has been released. The new release includes a useful feature to get icon sets, data bars or color scales objects used when adding conditional formatting to a cell or a range of cells. We have also added support for [rendering a worksheetâ€™s background in an output HTML file][1]. The component also supports parsing custom views and scenarios while converting from one Microsoft Excel file format to another.

Moreover, we have improved the Excel to PDF rendering feature. It sometimes took more time to convert large [Excel files to PDF][2]. The product now does not take much time to convert large Excel files to PDF.

In this release, several important issues have been addressed. For example, issues around reading and writing Microsoft Excel (2003 - 2007/2010) file formats, rendering and calculating PivotTables, rendering charts, rendering image files from charts and exporting to PDF have been resolved. An improvement is also made to Aspose.Cells for .NET's formula calculation engine.

We have made a few enhancements and fix some bugs regarding edit cells where there is a large dataset in the worksheet in the web-based Grid control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET. We have also fixed a bug in the **acwmain.js** file for certain features and operations.
