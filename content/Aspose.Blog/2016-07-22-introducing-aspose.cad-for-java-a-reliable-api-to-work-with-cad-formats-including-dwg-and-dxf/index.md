# Coming Soon: Aspose.CAD for Java

After Aspose.CAD for .NET, we are pleased to share that Aspose.CAD for Java API will soon be launched. The API will enable Java application developers to manipulate DWG and DXF documents in their applications without worrying about the underlying complexity of AutoCAD.

# Based on Aspose.CAD for .NET

We are in the process of preparing and launching Aspose.CAD for Java. It has been built on top of Aspose.CAD for .NET and as a first step, we have implemented majority of the .NET API functionality. In the launching version, the emphasis has been on reading CAD file formats and exporting to popular output formats such as BMP, JPG, GIF, PDF and TIFF.

# Stay Tuned

Aspose.CAD for Java has great potential for Java application developers to provide the capability of manipulating DWG and DXF documents in their applications. We are planning to release the API in near future and make it available to our users. If you have any queries related to the features or functionality of the API, you can write to us in [Aspose.CAD forum][2].
