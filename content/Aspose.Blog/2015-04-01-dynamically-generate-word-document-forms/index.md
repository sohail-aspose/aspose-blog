## About Digerati Solutions



{{< figure align=center src="images/Picture1.png" alt="Digerati Company logo">}}


[Digerati Solutions][1] creates high-quality websites and tailor-made software solutions. We are a small, tight-knit team. All our sites and applications are custom-built to fit the needs of our clients.

## Problem

Digerati required a way to dynamically generate forms and documentation for a system that manages state school sport competitions and registrations. We needed a solution that would make it easy for our client to customize the branding and layout of the forms without low-level technical expertise.

## Solution

We decided that the best way to achieve this would be to let our client design the form template using Microsoft Word, and then inject custom data dynamically at runtime. [Aspose.Words for .NET][2] was found to be the best tool for the job. It came highly recommended by the .NET community, and the [documentation][3] appeared to be quite good.

The first screenshot shows our MS Word template with the mail merge fields such as TeamName, Year, LoginUrl, and a table of Apparel.

The second screenshot shows the output (_some fields hidden for privacy_). It was easy to inject our data into the mail merge, and what surprised us, even more, was how easy it was to inject repeating data. In this case, a table of apparel.

## Experience

### **Finding a solution**

We tried other products but found them difficult to use, buggy, or have gaps in features. [Aspose.Words for .NET][4] came highly recommended on stackoverflow.com.

### **Implementation**

We found it very easy to integrate [Aspose.Words for .NET][5] with our system; no hiccups – it just worked straight away. The API is mostly [self-documenting][6] – a savvy developer could, for the most part, can 'guess' class and method names and use the tool without reference to the [documentation][7]. For more complex operations, the [documentation][8] proved to be very comprehensive, and where it lacked, answers were found on the [forums][9].

### **Outcome**

[Aspose.Words for .NET][10] made it easy to solve our problem, and made [mail-merge from within a .NET application][11] possible, where other solutions could not.

## Next Steps

We will use [Aspose.Words for .NET][12] moving forward in applications that require documents to be generated with dynamic content.

## Summary

Having used other similar tools in the past, it became clear to us that [Apose.Words for .NET][13] is a cut above the rest, both in terms of quality, reliability, and ease of use. We would recommend it to any developer looking for a way to [manipulate Word documents][14].
