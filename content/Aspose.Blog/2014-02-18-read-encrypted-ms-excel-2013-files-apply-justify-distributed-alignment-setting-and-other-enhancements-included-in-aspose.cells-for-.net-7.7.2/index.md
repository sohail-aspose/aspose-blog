[![Aspose.Cells for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Cells-for-net_100.png)Aspose.Cells for .NET 7.7.2 has been released. This new release supports reading password protected Microsoft Excel 2013 files. We provide the Style.IsJustifyDistributed property so you can apply the justify distributed setting while applying text alignment settings on cells.

We also provide support for B3 (13.9 x 19.7 inches) and Business Card (90 mm x 55 mm) PaperSizeType. We have added the PaperB3 and PaperBusinessCard enumeration members to the PaperSizeType enumeration that can be used when setting page options.

## Fixes and Other Enhancements

In the new version, we also support retrieving the RemovePersonalInformation setting as some developers have asked for this feature. XLT format support has also been enhanced.

In this release, several important issues have been addressed. For example, issues around reading and rendering Microsoft Excel file formats, numbers formatting, applying conditional formatting,Â rendering and manipulating pivot tables, rendering images from Excel worksheets, reading and writing HTML files, rendering and manipulating charts, rendering images files from charts and exporting Excel workbooks to PDF format have been resolved. A few improvements are also made to Aspose.Cells for .NET's formula calculation engine. We have fixed a few exceptions when reading and writing Microsoft Excel files too.
