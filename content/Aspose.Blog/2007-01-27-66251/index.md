Just found a nice Microsoft KB article that shows how to change the way Internet Explorer opens linked Microsoft Word documents. By default, they are opened in-place in the browser window; many users seem require another behavior, when the documents are opened in a separate instance of Microsoft Word. I have tested it and it worked. Hope this will be useful.
