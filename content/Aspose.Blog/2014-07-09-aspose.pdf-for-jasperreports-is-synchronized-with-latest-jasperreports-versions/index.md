[![Aspose.Pdf for SSRS icon][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/06/aspose-Pdf-for-JasperReports_100.png)The Aspose.Pdf product family contains a range of award winning APIs and components for PDF file generation and manipulation. Aspose.Pdf for Java is an API for PDF manipulation on the Java platform. Extending the feature of this API, we developed the Aspose.Pdf for JasperReports component, which is a flexible solution designed to export reports from JasperReports and JasperServer to Portable Document Format (PDF). Important report features such as tables, charts and images are converted to PDF with the highest degree of precision. Now we are excited to announce the release of [Aspose.Pdf for JasperReports 1.3.0][2] which is synchronized with the latest JasperReports versions.

In this release, the image rendering feature has been improved greatly and also supports rendering maps in the output PDF. Please get the download and start exploring the exciting new release of [Aspose.Pdf for JasperReports 1.3.0][3].
