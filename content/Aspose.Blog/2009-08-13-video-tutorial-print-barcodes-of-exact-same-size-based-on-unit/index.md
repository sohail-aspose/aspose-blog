We have recently updated our Aspose.BarCode documentation and added a new video tutorial. In this video, we showed how can you print a barcode according to fixed size (height and width), based on the selected unit. The unit can be pixel, millimeter or point. We created a sample application in this tutorial using Microsoft Visual Studio and Aspose.BarCode for .NET to print the barcode of size specified by the user. Please visit http://www.aspose.com/documentation/visual-components/aspose.barcode-for-.net-and-java/print-barcode-of-exact-size-based-on-unit.html for viewing this video tutorial.

The trial version of Aspose.BarCode is available from [http://www.aspose.com/community/files/53/visual-components/aspose.barcode-for-.net-and-java/default.aspx][1] and for online documentation and Programmer's Guide, please visit http://www.aspose.com/documentation/visual-components/aspose.barcode-for-.net-and-java/index.html.
