We enhance excel to pdf conversion in this version; it is now possible to directly export excel files to pdf stream. We also add MS Excelâ€™s Subtotals feature to subtotal ranges of data in the worksheet. Moreover, we have improved performance of encrypting / decrypting Excel 2007 files; there are some other enhancements and fixes too.
