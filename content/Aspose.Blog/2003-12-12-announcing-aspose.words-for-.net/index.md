**December 12, 2003 – Auckland, New Zealand –** Aspose already helps developers work with Microsoft Excel and Adobe PDF files from within their own .NET applications. Aspose.Words, launched today, adds Microsoft Word files to the pool of files that Aspose components allow you to work with.

Microsoft Word files are ubiquitous in business. Developers who develop applications that include document management will be pleased to know that a lot of the hard work has been taken out of parsing, manipulating and converting Word. Aspose.Words is a class library that allows you to work with Word files from within .NET applications, independent of Windows Automation and without needing Microsoft Word installed. 

Aspose creates components for developers who need to work with popular file formats from within their own applications. Instead of learning a file format inside out, our products let developers get on with coding their solution. Our components mange complex binary formats, quickly and efficiently.

*   Aspose.Cells for .NET, a class library for working with Microsoft Excel files in .NET applications, was released in January this year.
*   Aspose.Pdf for .NET, a class  library for working with Adobe PDF files in .NET applications, was released in March this year.

Next year will see us adding to our product portfolio and extending the feature set of our existing products.
