[7z][1] is an archiving format for compressing files and folders with a high compression ratio. It is based on **Open Source** architecture which makes it possible to use any compression and **encryption** algorithms. The **7z** archive composition is now implemented with Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm **[LZMA][2] compression** in [Aspose.ZIP for .NET 19.10 API][3] which is now publicly available for download and usage to create .7z archive files with LZMA compression. We have introduced many public types and methods in this version of Aspose.ZIP for .NET. Please check [release notes][4] to learn about what enhancements, new features and bug resolutions are included.

## 7-Zip Archive with LZMA Compression

The LZMA (_Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm_) is developed to perform "lossless data compression". Variable size of compression-dictionary and high compression-ratio of the LZMA algorithm makes it similar to the dictionary **compression** scheme that LZ77 algorithm offers. The following code example demonstrates [how to create a 7z archive with LZMA compression.][5]
