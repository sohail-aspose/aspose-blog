[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/09/erik-res.jpg)[Daedtech.com][2] is home to Erik Dietrich who is a popular developer, writer and pretty much everything else in between! Erik has written a lot of software over the years, having walked the standard advancement track for a software developer from “Software Engineer” on up to “CIO.”  After that, he went into business for himself full time, remaining in and around the business of software development.  Erik has written a lot of different kinds of software across a lot of different domains and in a lot of different languages and has been a team member, team leader, architect, consultant, manager, and tech executive while having a lot of fun doing it!

What Erik discovered through the course of this career drift is that he _loves_ to write, and is happy sharing some great thoughts on various topics on his blog and in his books. Aspose loves getting behind passionate developers and the community which is why we are sponsoring Erik, [Go check out his writings now][3].
