summary: 'In the [previous post][1], you have seen how to generate and read different types of barcodes using C#. However, in certain cases, you have to deal with non-English characters. For example, when you work with Arabic, Latin, Greek, or similar languages. In such cases, you may need to encode the characters into Unicode standards i.e. [UTF-8][2].

In the [previous post][3], you have seen how to generate and read different types of barcodes using C#. However, in certain cases, you have to deal with non-English characters. For example, when you work with Arabic, Latin, Greek, or similar languages. In such cases, you may need to encode the characters into Unicode standards i.e. [UTF-8][4]. In accordance with that, this article covers **how to generate and read barcodes using UTF-8 encoding in C#**.

## C# API to Generate Barcodes using UTF-8 Encoding {#API-to-Generate-Barcodes-using-UTF-8-Encoding}

[Aspose.BarCode for .NET][9] is a powerful C# API for barcode generation and recognition. Using the API, you can work with a wide range of barcode symbologies. In addition, the API supports generating barcodes using UTF-8 encoding. You can either [download][10] the API or install it using [NuGet][11].

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.BarCode
```

## Generate Barcode using UTF-8 Encoding in C# {#Generate-Barcode-with-UTF-8-Encoding-in-csharp}

The following are the steps to generate barcode using UTF-8 encoding.

*   First, create an instance of [BarcodeGenerator][12] class and specify the barcode type using [EncodeTypes][13].
*   Set barcode's text using [BarcodeGenerator.CodeText][14] property.
*   Set UTF-8 text encoding using [BarcodeGenerator.Parameters.Barcode.QR.CodeTextEncoding][15] property (replace QR according to the barcode type you have specified in _BarcodeGenerator_ constructor).
*   Generate barcode using [BarcodeGenerator.GenerateBarCodeImage()][16] method and save returned image into a [Bitmap][17] object.
*   Finally, save the barcode image as a file using [Bitmap.Save(String)][18] method.

The following code sample shows how to generate a barcode using UTF-8 encoding in C#.

## Read UTF-8 Encoded Barcode using C# {#Recognize-Barcode-with-UTF-8-Encoding-in-csharp}

The following are the steps to recognize UTF-8 encoded barcode using C#.

*   Use [BarCodeReader][19] class to load the barcode image.
*   Loop through each [BarCodeResult][20] returned by [BarCodeReader.ReadBarCodes()][21] method.
*   Create an object of the [Encoding][22] class and set encoding to UTF-8.
*   Get the char array from the bytes returned by the [BarCodeResult][23] object.
*   Build Unicode string from the characters to get the barcode text.
*   Finally, print the retrieved barcode text.

The following code sample shows how to recognize barcodes using UTF-8 encoding in C#.
