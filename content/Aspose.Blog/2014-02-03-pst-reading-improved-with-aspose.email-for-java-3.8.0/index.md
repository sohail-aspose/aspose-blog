[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/aspose-Email-for-Java_100.png)Aspose.Email for Java 3.8.0 has been released with a number of improvements.

This month’s release includes an important enhancement related to reading messages from a semi-corrupt PST file. This makes it possible to read the non-corrupted messages from the PST file which was not possible earlier and provides more stability to PST reading operations.

This month’s release also enhances Aspose.Email's TNEF messages reading capability by filling the named properties collection from TNEF.  This improves the overall Outlook message loading functionality from TNEF in cases where calendar items are encapsulated within a TNEF.

In addition to the enhancements, this month’s release also includes a number of bug fixes that affected certain API functionality. These include issues related to messages encoding and conversions, message rendering to MHT and TIFF, start and end times for calendar items, and some exceptions.

For more details on what is new and fixed, please refer to Aspose.Email’s [Product Download Page][2].
