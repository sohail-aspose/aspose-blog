Aspose.Diagram for .NET 2.0.0 has been released. This release supports adding group shapes with children by specifying group master. You can also specify complex group master e.g. from network template or 3-D box from basic template.

A new **AddShape** overload has also been included in this release which allows you to set width, height and position of the shape while adding the shape.
