We are really delighted to announce the release of version 18.2 of the **Aspose.Words for SharePoint** API. Conversion to **Pdf/A** in **UI** is supported now. We have also added two new options in API to convert documents to PDF/A-1a and PDF/A-1b standards.

When you specify PdfCompliance.PdfA1a, the output file will comply with the **PDF/A-1a** standard. This level includes all the requirements of **PDF/A-1b** and additionally requires that document structure be included (also known as being "**tagged**"), with the objective of ensuring that document content can be searched and re-purposed.

When you specify PdfCompliance.PdfA1b, the output file will comply with the **PDF/A-1b** standard. PDF/A-1b has the objective of ensuring reliable reproduction of the visual appearance of the document.

This release also comes with some very exciting features to enhance the usability of the API. This version also sees the codebase better tweaked and the core functionality closer to Aspose.Words for .NET 18.2, which is the base product that **Aspose.Words for SharePoint 18.2** is ported from.

We recommend you to download the latest release and check out all the features introduced in the base Aspose.Words for .NET API. You can download the latest release of Aspose.Words for SharePoint from the following link:
