[![Aspose.Slides for Android logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/12/aspose_slides-for-android-e1386844644397.png) We are proud to share the release announcement of Aspose.Slides for Android 1.1.0. This new component has been built on top of our award winning product Aspose.Slides for Java, and inherits all the features and capabilities from that product except rendering options at the moment. The component empowers Android developers to work with PowerPoint presentations in their applications without any dependence on Microsoft PowerPoint. For more information about the product capabilities, please visit [product description page][2].

Aspose.Slides for Android empowers the developers to create simple or complex presentations. It allows you to add variety of shapes and formatting them. The complete support for working with MSO charts has also been added in this release. It also provides the support for managing OLE frames, manipulating SmartArt shapes, using PowerPoint tables and ActiveX objects. The feature support for slide transition effects and incorporating the animations inside slides has also been made available in this new release. Please visit this documentation link for list of available features in this new component.

At present Aspose.Slides for Android does not offer rendering support and you cannot convert PowerPoint presentations to PDF, XPS, TIFF, PDF notes, SVG and slide thumbnails in formats like BMP, PNG and JPEG. However, we are working on these features and subsequent releases of Aspose.Slides for Android shall inherit rendering support from Aspose.Slides for Java.

In order to get started with the product, we have also added a complete programmer guide section that will enable you to verify and use different product features.
