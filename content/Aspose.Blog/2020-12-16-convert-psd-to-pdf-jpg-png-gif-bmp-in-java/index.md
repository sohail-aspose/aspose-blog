summary: '[PSD][1] format is used by Adobe Photoshop in order to save the data related to graphical designs. A PSD file may consist of single or multiple layers that collectively form the graphics. However, to view or embed the PSD images directly into your web or desktop applications is not feasible. In order to cope with this issue, you can convert the PSD document to PDF or raster image formats. In accordance with that, this article provides some simple ways of converting PSD files to [PDF][2], [PNG][3], [JPEG][4], [GIF][5], and other image formats using Java.'
