Rendering of non-English text especially RTL inside PDF has never been so much easy.Â The new version of Aspose.Pdf for .NET 5.1.0 provides the support for placing Arabic, Hebrew etc text inside PDF in their normal way. Create Multiple TOC (Table Of Contents) in a single PDF, specify different background color for each Heading object (_even if they are on the same level_). A very intelligent feature of placing image as table cell background has been introduced. This feature allows you to cut and place a specific portion of image either it can be Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left or Bottom-Right. Easily create Round bordered tables and table rows, precise rendering of padding/margin for table cells and much more. Please get a chance to visit the following link to see the complete list of features offered and problems fixed in in this new release. You may also get your copy of latest version from [this link][1].
