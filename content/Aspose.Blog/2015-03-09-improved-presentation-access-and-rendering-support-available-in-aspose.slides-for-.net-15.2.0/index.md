We have also improved the right to left text rendering support include Hebrew language rendering. Many of chart elements rendering issues including chart titles, axis text, legends and chart labels have been addressed for different type of charts. The rendering performance has been significantly improved for generated thumbnails, exported Pdf and SVG files.

We have also resolved issues related to slide cloning that earlier resulted in missing data in cloned slides. The support for removing the macros has also been improved in this release. The more details about the feature can be observed in article Removing VBA Macros in Presentation.

We have resolved the issues that appeared while accessing, saving and rendering presentation to PDF, HTML or slide thumbnails, which resulted in different exceptions like UnexpectedFontParsing Exception , SystemOutOfMemory Exception , NullReference, ArgumentException, PptxReadException, ObjectReferenceException,and IndexOutOfRange in previous releases. The issue of presentation repair message appearing in Aspose.Slides generated presentations when viewed in different PowerPoint versions has also been addressed and resolved in this release.
