Aspose.Cells for .NET 7.4.3 has been released. This month’s release includes an enhancement for copying a cell over a range of cells. We have added a new overload: AutoFitColumns(int firstRow, int firstColumn, int lastRow, int lastColumn, AutoFitterOptions options), so you can use auto-fitting options even in a range. Similarly, you may now copy tables when copying ranges. We have also made enhancement regarding the Smart Markers's Group Data feature. We have fixed a few exceptions when reading and writing Excel files and resolved an issue on Mono for the exception “Unknown Heap Type: SmartAssembly”.

In the new release, several other important issues have also been addressed. For example, issues around rendering Excel files, rendering PivotTables and Pivot Charts, Excel to HTML conversion, applying conditional formatting, rendering image files from charts/worksheets and exporting to PDF have been resolved. Issues pertaining to the formula calculation engine have also been fixed.

We have made a few enhancements in Aspose.Cells for .NET's web-based Grid control. For example, GridWeb now allows you to copy cell formatting (background color, alignment etc.) with data for its copy/paste feature. We also fix some bugs regarding cells selection, data validation and number formatting etc. in GridWeb. We have also improved GridWeb’s MS Ajax feature. We have also fixed a formula calculation issue in the desktop-based Grid control (GridDesktop).
