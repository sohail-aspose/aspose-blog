We have released the new version of Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET. In Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET 3.8.0, we have improved image extraction feature. The quality of extracted images is much better in this version. We have also enhanced PdfViewer class in order to improve the quality of the output when printed using Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET. PdfConverter class now produces output images of better quality. In addition to that, we have added a new feature to get submit button names.
