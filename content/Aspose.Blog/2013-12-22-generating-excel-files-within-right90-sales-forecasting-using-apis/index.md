As the leader in Enterprise Performance Acceleration, its powerful enterprise software platform helps organizations grow revenue, optimize expense and accelerate transformation through a model where every customer has access to every product in our portfolio.

Right90 Sales Forecasting is one of the leading products which helps manufacturing companies see and manage changes to their sales forecasts. Right90 is intuitive enough for anyone to use and provides actionable insight to help managers stay alert to changes, be confident of their number and reduce potential risks. Right90 delivers rapid results through a flexible,on-demand platform that accelerates sales adoption and business value while minimizing risk and IT infrastructure.

## Requirements Scenario

Many sales teams in manufacturing companies are very comfortable using Excel to capture forecasts and have defined processes using Excel as their forecast data collection tool. While Right90 provides a simple yet powerful web interface for updating, rolling up and managing changes to forecasts, we also wanted to provide a way for our manufacturing customers to easily extract their forecast information into Excel. In addition, we also needed to be able to track their changes in that workbook and allow them to easily submit those changes back into our system for aggregated processing, rollup, and analysis. As an on-demand enterprise forecasting solution, Right90â€™s top priorities for Excel integration were performance and reliability.

## Solution Implementation

We compared several Excel file generation products and chose to implement our solution using [Aspose.Cells for .NET][1]. The decision to use Aspose.Cells was made easy by its concise collection of code examples, [documentation][2] and [responsive customer support][3]. We implemented [Aspose.Cells for .NET][4] behind a set of web services in a high availability high transaction web application.

## Benefits

We used the following [Aspose.Cells for .NET][5] features to create rich UI Excel worksheets:

*   [Cell Formatting][6]
*   [Auto Filters][7]
*   [Conditional Formatting][8]
*   [Cell Comments][9]
*   [Inserting Objects (images)][10]
*   [Hyperlinks][11]

## Conclusion
