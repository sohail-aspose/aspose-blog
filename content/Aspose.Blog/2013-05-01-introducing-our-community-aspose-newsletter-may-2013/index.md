## Introducing our Community

Last month we reached 200,000 registered users, an important milestone to us. This month, we can introduce some of our new community members to you. Our users come from a wide variety of industries and from all over the globe. They have many different challenges and Aspose are pleased to help with some of those. [Meet our community][1].

### Aspose Launches Examples Application

We have created example applications for .NET and Java. The applications let you run Aspose code examples from your desktop. They are automatically updated so that you always have the latest products and examples. Try them out: download [Aspose Examples for .NET][2] or [Aspose Examples for Java][3].

### Aspose.Pdf for Java and Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java Merges

Last year, we merged Aspose.Pdf for .NET and Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET. We have now autoported this version to Java, effectively merging Aspose.Pdf for Java and Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java. Our Java users can now create and manipulate existing PDF files with one convenient API. Find out more.

Thank you for reading,
