Portable Document Format (PDF) is one of the most commonly used file formats today. We oftenÂ  come across the requirement to edit PDF files in our applications. [Aspose.PDF for .NET][1] allows developers to create and manipulate PDF documents programmatically using C#. Our C# PDF API has a powerful feature to manage the contents of PDF files like attachments, annotation, form fields, etc.

## ASP.NET PDF Editor

An ASP.NET sample application has been developed to edit PDF files online using Aspose.PDF for .NET. It provides features like adding or deleting text and pages, highlighting text, exporting the file as images, export as text file and export the updated PDF file.
