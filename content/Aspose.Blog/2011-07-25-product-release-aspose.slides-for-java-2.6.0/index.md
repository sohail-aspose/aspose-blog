We like to share the announcement of release of Aspose.Slides for Java 2.6.0. This is primarily a maintenance release that contains the fix for several issues shared by customers. Issues related to presentation access in PowerPoint 2010 and Linux environment have been resolved.  A new parser for extracting text from PPTX using Aspose.Slides for Java has also been implemented along with support for some of missing shapes.

Support for Japanese characters rendering along with missing text rendering in exported PDF’s and thumbnails has been improved in this new release.  Some of presentations access issues have also been rectified.
