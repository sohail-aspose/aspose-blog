We're pleased to announce that the [new version 16.12.0 of Aspose.Diagram for .NET API][1] is now live. The new version of the API allows developers to modify the gradient fill of a shape in the Visio drawing. The gradient fill improves the appearance of shapes. Developers can also find an improvement in exporting Visio drawings with an embedded Excel worksheet to PDFs. The recent version also covers a number of regular bug fixes and enhancements. Developers can install an Aspose.Diagram Nuget package in their .NET applications because we publish each version as [a NuGet package on the NuGet gallery][2]. We recommend our clients upgrade old version of Aspose.Diagram API to this latest one. For details on API fixes, please check [Release Notes][3] having a complete list of the features, enhancements and bug fixes.

## Modify the Gradient Fill Data of a Visio Shape

Visio shape gradients provide a fast way to give shapes a professional look, especially for flowcharts and other diagrams that will be seen by a wide audience. Using Aspose.Diagram API, developers can retrieve and modify the gradient fill data as per their needs. Developers can also get the gradient stops from each gradient fill to set the position, color and transparency. This help topic shows how to modify the gradient fill data of a Visio shape: [Modify the Gradient of a Visio Shape][4]

## Enhanced Export of Visio with Embedded Excel to a PDF

Aspose.Diagram API has support of manipulating the embedded OLE objects. In few reported use cases, clients were converting the source Visio diagrams to PDFs and facing the problem of missing embedded Excel worksheet. We have enhanced the export of Visio diagrams with embedded worksheet. It is now better than previous.

This version also addresses the issues of incomplete rendering of the shapes, extra whitespace around the actual drawing, the invisibility of group shapes and the general formatting problems of the diagram. These enhancements and bug fixes improve performance and accuracy of Aspose.Diagram API. Please check a list of the resolved defects:

*   Fixed: Incomplete rendering of the circle shape on saving in VDX.
*   Fixed: VSD to PDF and HTML export - the extra white space on the left side of the drawing.
*   Fixed: VSD to SVG export - the background color of container turns into black.
*   Fixed: Can't group shapes second time in a Visio Drawing page.
*   Fixed: The group shape becomes invisible on adding circular shapes in a VSDM.
*   Fixed: Page.AddShape method shows an invalid error on adding a dynamic connector.
*   Fixed: Page.AddShape method shows an invalid error on adding a dynamic connector.
