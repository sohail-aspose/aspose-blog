Do you like this diagram? I had a great local designer drawn this up for us. We can make more.

Does it make it clear that Aspose.Words is about Document Conversions, Programming, Rendering and Reporting?

Do you think it is suitable to have on the product home page [http://www.aspose.com/categories/file-format-components/aspose.words-for-.net-and-java/default.aspx][1]?

Thanks.
