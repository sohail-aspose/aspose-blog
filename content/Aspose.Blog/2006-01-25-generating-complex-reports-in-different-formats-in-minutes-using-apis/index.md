## About QuantumLeap.Pro

**[QLBS][1]** was founded in New Zealand in 2002 by Steve Lewin, a brilliant business consultant, and technologist.  We are based in New Zealand where innovation happens 'on the edge'. It is no coincidence that the first cloud accounting system came from New Zeland. And after cloud accounting comes cloud compliance - and we are it. ​

We installed a version of [Aspose.Words for .NET][2] (3.4) having installed v2.5 about July last year (2005). Prior to [Aspose][3], I used Microsoft Word automation to generate reports, with predictable results: slow and unreliable. As per our business requirements, we produce quite complex reports from our application and under Microsoft Word, the run time on fast computers was about 15-20 minutes/report (_each report results in about 40 heavily formatted pages_). We develop in .NET and with those performance times, we had to build a report queue management process so reports could be run off-line and multiple reports stacked up as needed.

After installing [Aspose.Words for .NET][4] the programming changes were not too bad - as took about a day to implement, then I ran the first report. I was convinced there must have been a bug because that report took about 2 seconds to run, but Word popped up on the screen with the report in it. Checked it carefully and it was all there! Needless to say, our clients were very happy to have such a performance improvement.

From a support point of view, our life has become so much simpler. The under Microsoft Word the reporting mechanism was the weakest part of the system (_subject to breaking for the most obscure reasons_). With [Aspose.Words for .NET][5], the whole problem area has resolved. Our support teams are very happy!

A week ago as the lead developer, I needed to implement quickly a new Word report. The processing was much more complex than we have had to-date. v2.5 did not seem to have the tools I needed hence we upgraded. Under v3.4, all our existing reports were generated perfectly, this was a very nice bonus. To develop the new report, I needed to start navigating the document. The Node object structure gave me quite a headache until I finally twigged to how it all worked with Composite Nodes. From that point, the process of generating such a complex report has become very straightforward. I've just finished demonstrating the final product to the client. I originally had 7 days to develop the report, then late last week, they moved the time-frame up 3 days till today and I have been able to meet the deadline. This complex report also produces 30-40 pages in less than 2 seconds.

Needless to say, I'm very grateful to you guys for the quality, reliability, and performance of your control. This is one of the best I have used. The design of the objects is very sound (_once I actually came to grips with it_). I could not have tackled the report problems, without the facilities you have built into [Aspose.Words for .NET][6].

Thanks and keep it going. You're welcome to use this feedback as a reference. If you want more details for a case study, let me know and I'll send you what you need.

User makes choices in the application and selects to generate a report.

[Aspose.Words for .NET][7] generates the report in the DOC format, so it can be opened in Microsoft Word.
