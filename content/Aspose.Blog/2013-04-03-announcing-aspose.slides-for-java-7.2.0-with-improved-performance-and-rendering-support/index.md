We like to share the announcement of new release of Aspose.Slides for Java 7.2.0.

Now, Â Aspose.Slides for Java provides support for setting default fonts for rendering presentation to PDF or TIFF. We have also included support for FontsLoader implementation which enables you to load the fonts used for rendering from a specified location without installing them.

The text to HTML support has also been enhanced in this release. Certain exceptions support has been included in this new release, including support for exception when the wrong locale is selected. Many presentation rendering issues have also been rectified, especially to do with generating PDF's or slide thumbnails. We've also added support for TIFF compression. We have resolved some of presentation access and slide cloning issues along with improved performance as compared to predecessor.
