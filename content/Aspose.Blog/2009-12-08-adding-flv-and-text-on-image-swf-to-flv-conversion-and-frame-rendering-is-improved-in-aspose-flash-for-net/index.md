Aspose.Flash for .NET 2.3.0 is released. In this latest version, we have improved the support to add text and FLV file over a background image. SWF to FLV conversion process is also improved. The process of rendering individual frames of a Flash movie into images is enhanced.  
  
We have also introduced a new overload for Unpack method to place a video stream at the specified depth with a specified id. A new feature, to manage embedded FLV streams extraction process, is introduced as Extract method. This allows you to extract an FLV stream with a particular id.  
  
You can see the details and download the latest version from the [Aspose.Flash for .NET download section][1].
