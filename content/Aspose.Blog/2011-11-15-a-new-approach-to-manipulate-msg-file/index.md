![Aspose.Email logo][1]

We have just released Aspose.Email for Java 1.1. In this version we introduced a new class:Â MessageObject. It allows you to manipulate the properties of an MSG file in a simplistic manner. We hope it becomes useful to our customers and evolves further to replace the MapiMessage class.
