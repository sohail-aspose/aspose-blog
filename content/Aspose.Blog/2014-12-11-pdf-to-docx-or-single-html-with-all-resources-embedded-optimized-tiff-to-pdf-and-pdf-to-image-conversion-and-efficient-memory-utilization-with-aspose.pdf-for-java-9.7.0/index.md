It gives us immense pleasure to announce the release of [Aspose.PDF for Java 9.7.0][1] which offers some great new features. It provides document manipulation and conversion from various formats to PDF in Java. Furthermore, you can now convert **PDF to DOCX, HTML** or other file formats. Keeping this tradition alive, this new release provides a couple of new features as well as improvements in the API for complex scenarios handling for the image to PDF conversion, PDF to image conversion, text extraction, watermark manipulation and much more.

## Convert PDF to DOCX in Java

Aspose.PDF for Java already supports converting PDF files to Microsoft Word (DOC) format. The DocSaveOptions class makes it possible to render a PDF file to Microsoft Word format. This class also provides numerous properties that improve the process of converting PDF files to DOC format. Among these properties, Mode enables you to specify a recognition mode for PDF content. You can specify any value from the RecognitionMode enumeration for this property. Each of these values has specific benefits and limitations. However starting this new release, Aspose.Pdf for Java also offers the capabilities to convert PDF files to DOCX format. For further information, please visit [Convert PDF to DOC or DOCX Format][2].

## Convert PDF to HTML in Java with Embedded Resources

**HTML to PDF** and **PDF to HTML** are some of the features our customers use most. During conversion, all resources (fonts, images and CSS) from a PDF file are saved in a separate folder in the same directory as the output HTML. However, we were asked to provide a feature for converting a PDF file to HTML format and generate a single HTML file with all resources embedded. The current release of Aspose.PDF for Java offers this feature. For further details, please visit PDF to HTML - Single HTML with all Resources Embedded.

## Miscellaneous Fixes

As well as the enhancements and features discussed above, there have been numerous fixes related to **HTML to PDF** conversion, **PDF to Excel** conversion, **XPS to PDF** conversion, **PDF to TIFF** conversion, text replacement, text extraction, rendering **PDF to XPS**, creating TOCs in PDF files, and printing PDFs with embedded fonts.
