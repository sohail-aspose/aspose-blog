We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Pdf for .NET 8.0.0][2] which provides better support for existing file manipulation. This new release has specific improvements for PDF printing, PDF to DOC, XPS and various image format conversion. We have also focused on watermarking, text extraction, PDF compression and bookmarking functionalities.

Please note that we recently introduced an Examples dashboard which contains code examples for Aspose.Total for .NET products. From this release, the Examples dashboard is part of the product installer. So once you have installed this new version, you can find the Examples dashboard in the Examples folder in Aspose.Pdf for .NET's product installation directory.
