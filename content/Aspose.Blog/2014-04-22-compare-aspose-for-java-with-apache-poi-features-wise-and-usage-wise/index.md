## Aspose for Java

[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/04/aspose-total-for-java21.png)Aspose provides a wide range of Java APIs for developers to create and manage various types of applications that deals with files and different formats.

Aspose facilitates the Java developers with [Aspose.Total][2] which includes following easy to use, efficient and separately downloadable components:

*   **Aspose.Cells** to deal with Microsoft Excel® and OpenOffice spreadsheets.
*   **Aspose.Words** for Microsoft Word and OpenOffice documents.
*   **Aspose.Slides** for Microsoft PowerPoint and OpenOffice presentation files.
*   **Aspose.Pdf** to create and manipulate PDF documents.
*   **Aspose.BarCode** for generation and recognition of barcodes.
*   **Aspose.Tasks** to deal with Microsoft Project®.
*   **Aspose.Email** to read and write email messages in various formats without Microsoft Outlook.
*   **Aspose.OCR** for optical character and marker recognition.
*   **Aspose.Imaging** to create, edit, draw and convert images.

## Apache POI

[![][3]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/04/apache-poi.png)The [Apache POI][4] Project's mission is to create and maintain Java APIs for manipulating various file formats based upon the Office Open XML standards (OOXML) and Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound Document format (OLE2).

You can read and write Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint files using Java. For each Microsoft Office application there exists a component module that attempts to provide a common high level Java API to both OLE2 and OOXML document formats.

*   This is most developed for **Excel** workbooks [(SS=HSSF+XSSF)][5].
*   Work is progressing for **Word** documents [(HWPF+XWPF)][6] and **PowerPoint** presentations [(HSLF+XSLF)][7].

## Aspose for Apache POI

Project [Aspose for Apache POI][8] shows how different functionalities can be achieved using Aspose Java APIs in comparison with Apache POI. Examples with their source codes are hosted on [CodePlex][9], [GitHub][10], [Bitbucket][11] and [SourceForge][12].

*   [Aspose.Cells vs Apache POI HSSF + XSSF][13]
*   [Aspose.Slides vs Apache POI HSLF + XSLF][14]
*   [Aspose.Words vs Apache POI HWPF + XWPF][15]
*   [Aspose.Email vs Apache POI HSMF][16]

These examples are also available at [CodePlex][17], [GitHub][18], [Bitbucket][19] and [SourceForge][20].

Aspose has many more features  than Apache POI to fulfill developer requirements. To highlight some of these features, following are few examples of  each module.

*   [Missing Features of Apachi POI SS available in Aspose.Cells][21]
*   [Missing Features of Apachi POI SL available in Aspose.Slides][22]
*   [Missing Features of Apachi POI WP available in Aspose.Words][23]
*   [Missing Features of Apache POI HSMF available in Aspose.Email][24]

You can review and download these examples at [CodePlex][25], [GitHub][26], [Bitbucket][27] and [SourceForge][28].

These examples are helpful for developers who want to compare Apache POI with Aspose or migrate from Apache POI to Aspose.

*   Many more examples are available at [Aspose Docs][29]. [Keep visiting us][30].
*   Raise your queries and suggest more examples via [interactive forums][31] or any of our supported social coding sites.
