[![Aspose.Cells logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/05/aspose.cells-logo2.jpg)We are happy to announce the release of Aspose.Cells for Java 7.3.3. In this release, we have included utility options that will make our users' lives easier. For example, you may get the last cell in a row that contains data by using the Row.getLastDataCell() method. You may also retrieve a common style that is shared by cells. We enhanced the feature for adding double quotes for the cell values in CSV file in such a way that you may add quotes to even empty cells if you need to. In this release, several important customer issues have been fixed as well as many important spreadsheets formatting, chart rendering and formatting, conditional formatting and PDF export issues.
