We have released Aspose.Tasks for .NET 3.2.0 with support to calculate BCWS, BCWP, ACWP and CV values from MPP 2003,2007 and 2010 files. With this release, the users will also be able to read StartVariance and FinishVariance values associated with the Tasks and Resource Assignments. We have also implemented the ProjectReader and ProjectWriter events for customized XML data processing. In addition to all these, we have also fixed the issues as reported by users.
