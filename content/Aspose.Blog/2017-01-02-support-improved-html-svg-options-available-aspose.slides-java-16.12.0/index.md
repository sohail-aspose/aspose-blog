We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for Java 16.12.0. This is a maintenance release whereby we have resolved several issues incurring in the product.

## New Features

We have improved the charts support by including feature for setting the custom distance between tick mark positions of horizontal axis. We have also included the support for getting and setting the picture compression for exporting HTML and SVG in HTMLOptions and SVGOptions classes respectively. The support for setting and getting external fonts handlings has also been included in SVGOptions class as well.

We have rectified several issues for presentation decks that earlier resulted in different exceptions like ArgumentException and PptxReadException on saving or accessing the presentation. We have improved the presentation rendering support as well in this release and have rectified several rendering issues related to charts, text and shapes rendering in export SVG, PDF, thumbnails and HTML.
