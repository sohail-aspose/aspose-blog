The [Auckland .NET user group][2] is a bi-monthly meetup of around 60-100 different members each month. Topics discussed included e topics include any part of the .NET framework, web technology or Windows apps.

Aspose is sponsoring a very special meetup at the Auckland .NET user group as Mads Torgersen, the .NET program manager from Microsoft stopping in for a talk. Mads leads the C# language design process, maintains the language specification and occasionally sticks his nose in other things, such as Visual Basic, TypeScript and Roslyn. We recommend if you are in in the neighbourhood to go [check them out][3] for an interesting talk.
