[![Aspose.Cells logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/05/aspose.cells-logo2.jpg)Aspose.Cells for .NET 7.3.5 has been released. This month’s release includes support for Microsoft Excel 2010's PowerPivot feature: you can now read PivotTables in XLSB files. We have enhanced the Aspose.Cells’ formula calculation engine, so you can skip formulas whose external links do not exist in the template file. A number of bug fixes are also included in this release along with improved calculation of chart objects in template files.

This release is also a maintenance release where several important issues have been fixed. Many issues around reading and writing spreadsheets (XLS, XLSX etc.), rendering shapes, copying and pasting ranges, rendering PivotTables and exporting to PDF have been resolved. Issues pertaining to charts and the formula calculation engine have also been corrected in this release.

We have made a few enhancements in the web-based Grid control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET. For example, GridWeb can read data validations in a template file loaded into it. It can now read and write HTML files as well. We also added more saving file formatting types (for example, XLSM, XLTX, ODS, tab delimited, TIFF, and so on). We have also fixed some issues regarding formulas for Microsoft Ajax.
