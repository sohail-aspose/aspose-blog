To make the text read-only, you often need to convert it to a PDF or some image format such as PNG. In a [previous article][6], we demonstrated how to convert the text in a [TXT][7] file to a PDF in Python applications. Today, you will learn **how to convert a text to a [PNG][8], [JPEG][9], or [GIF][10] image programmatically in Python**.

## Convert Text to PNG, JPEG, or GIF Image - Python Library {#API-to-Convert-Text-to-Image}

To convert text to an image format, we will use [Aspose.Words for Python][13]. The said library provides a wide range of features to create and manipulate Word documents. In addition, it allows you to convert text documents to other formats with high fidelity. Aspose.Words for Python can be installed from [PyPI][14] using the following pip command.

```
pip install aspose-words 
```

## Convert Text (TXT) to Image in Python {#Convert-Text-TXT-to-Image}

In most cases, TXT files are used to store plain text without any formatting, which is the simplest way to keep textual data. Therefore, let's use a TXT file and convert its text into PNG, JPEG, or GIF images. The following are the steps to convert text to images in Python.

*   Load the text file using the ****Document**** class.
*   Loop through all the pages in the document.
*   Extract each page using **Document.extract\_pages()** method.
*   Save page as PNG (or another image format) using the **Document.save()** method.

The following code sample shows how to convert text to images in Python.
