#### Aspose announces the Q3 2010 release of Aspose.Total

This month sees the release of the Q3 2010 release of our product suites, Aspose.Total, platform-specific compilations that bring together all of our components. Aspose.Total contains all the new features, fixes and improvements that we have made on our products since the last big release. For more information please read our press release.

The latest version of [Aspose.Total for .NET][1], [Aspose.Total for Java][2], [Aspose.Total for Reporting Services][3] and [Aspose.Total for JasperReports][4]  are available to download now.

#### Product Spotlight – Aspose.Network for .NET

[](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/51/.net-components/aspose.network-for-.net/default.aspx)[Aspose.Network for .NET][5] is a suite of flexible and easy-to-use .NET components for professional network programming. Aspose.Network for .NET includes implementation of most of the widely used network protocols as well as many utility classes to facilitate common development tasks.  Aspose.Network for .NET also provides classes and algorithms which offer a simple, standards-based interface that can support time-oriented recurrence patterns or schedules.

[Download the free Aspose.Network for .NET trial][6] and learn how it can make your network programming tasks a piece of cake.

#### Technical Article – Calculate the total through RuleSet actions

Microsoft Office InfoPath allows you to set a formula as the value of a field with the help of which you can calculate the sum of a column of the repeating table and display that sum in a new field. If you load the InfoPath form in [Aspose.Form for .NET][7] you’ll find that we don’t support that feature yet. Don’t let that stop you - we have a work around. Aspose.Form for .NET allows you to do the same thing using RuleSet actions.

Read the article to find out how.

#### Tutorial Video – Adding an image to an existing PDF file

In this video tutorial we show you just how easy it is to add an image to an existing PDF file using [Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET][8]. We create a simple .NET application that adds an image to an existing PDF document and then saves it.

Watch the tutorial.

#### Migration from Microsoft Office Automation to Aspose with Aspose.Slides for .NET

Tables can be created on a PowerPoint presentation slide using both VSTO and [Aspose.Slides for .NET][9]. Examples of both of these approaches are presented in our migration article. Using Aspose.Slides for .NET for this same task is simple and easy to implement.
