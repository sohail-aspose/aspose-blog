Hi All,

We have released Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services 1.4.0 for the users.

In this version, we introduce some Revolutionary Enhancements. The component now supports Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Reporting Services - one of the leading reporting platform. It also supports the evergreen Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Reporting Services for the users' demand. Moreover, the component can fully integrate with Microsoft Report Viewer 2008 in Local Mode. There are some other features and fixes too.
