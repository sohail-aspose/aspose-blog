We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Cells for .NET 7.2.0. This month’s release provides extensive support for the DataView object and now you can import more than 65,536 records; this was a restriction in the older versions. An important enhancement is also made for the ComboBox control for XLSM file format. Moreover, we have fixed a number of bugs, one of them is: “Build Error C2686” for C++ users especially. We have improved the quality of the chart-to-image, Excel-to-PDF conversion and worksheet-to-image features and fixed their relative formatting and other rendering issues as well. The pivot table rendering module is enhanced continuously.

We also fixed some issues regarding auto-fitting rows and Excel file’s rendering in both the desktop- and web-based grid controls provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET.
