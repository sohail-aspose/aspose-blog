The project [Aspose Java for Docx4j][1] shows how different tasks can be performed using Aspose for Java APIs in comparison with Docx4j. The project also covers the features that are only available in Aspose's APIs but not in Docx4j for Microsoft Word and Open Office documents.

Some of the examples are available to [download][2] and to give you a better idea of how the API works, many more detailed examples are available at [Aspose Docs][3].
