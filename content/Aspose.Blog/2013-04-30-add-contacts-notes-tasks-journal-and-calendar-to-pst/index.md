Aspose.Email for .NET 2.9.0 has been released with a number of new features and bug fixes.

Did you ever want Aspose.Email to provide support for adding contacts, notes, tasks, calendar and journal items to PST files in the same way that you add messages? This month's release brings you all these features. We now support adding MapiContact, MapiNote, [MapiTask][1], [MapiJournal][2] and [MapiCalendar][3] to PST.

In this month's release we've also fixed some important issues related to email conversion to MHTML, saving image from a VCard, processing ICS files, creating PSTs with a large number of email messages, saving attachments from message using stream and some exceptions.

To get further details about what's new and fixed, read the release notes on the [Aspose.Email for .NET release page][4].
