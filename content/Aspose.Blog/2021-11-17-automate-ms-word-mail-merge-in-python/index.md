## Python Library to Automate MS Word Mail Merge {#Python-Library-to-Automate-MS-Word-Mail-Merge}

To automate MS Word mail merge, we will use [Aspose.Words for Python][4]. It is a powerful library that lets you create and manipulate Word documents. Moreover, it allows you to create the mail merge templates and populate them seamlessly. Aspose.Words for Python can be installed from [PyPI][5] using the following pip command.

```
pip install aspose-words 
```

## Create a Mail Merge Template in Python {#Create-MS-Word-Mail-Merge-Template}

A mail merge template contains merge fields that are populated with the values in the data source. The template could be of [DOT][6], [DOTX][7], [DOC][8], or [DOCX][9] format. In order to create a mail merge template, you can use MS Word. However, to automate this procedure in Python, you can follow the below steps.

*   Create an object of _DocumentBuilder_ class.
*   Insert text using _DocumentBuilder.insert\_text\_input()_ method.
*   Insert the merge field using _DocumentBuilder.insert\_field()_ method.
*   Repeat inserting text and merge fields as required.
*   Save the template as a file using _DocumentBuilder.document.save()_ method.

The following code sample shows how to create a DOCX mail merge template using Python.

## Generate Word Document using Mail Merge Template in Python {#Generate-Word-Document-using-Mail-Merge-Template}

Now when you have created the mail merge template, it's time to populate its fields with values. The following are the steps to generate a Word document from a mail merge template in Python.

*   Load the mail merge template using _Document_ class.
*   Call _Document.mail\_merge.execute()_ method and pass data in the form of an array.
*   Save the generated document using _Document.save()_ method.

The following code sample shows how to generate a Word document from mail merge template.
