PSD images are commonly used to design graphics. In certain situations, you may need to **convert a [PSD][1] file to a [TIFF][2] image** for previewing the contents in different system environments. The following sections explain the PSD conversion scenarios:

*   [PSD to TIFF Image Converter – C# API Installation][3]
*   [Convert PSD to TIFF Image Programmatically using C#][4]
*   [Convert PSD to TIFF Image with Compression in C#][5]

## PSD to TIFF Image Converter – C# API Installation {#section1}

[Aspose.PSD for .NET][6] API supports working with PSD and several other file formats. You can configure the API by downloading the DLL file from the [Downloads][7] section or by using the following [NuGet][8] installation command:

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.PSD
```

## Convert PSD to TIFF Image Programmatically using C# {#section2}

You can convert a PSD file to a TIFF image by following the steps below:

1.  Load the input PSD image with the [Image][9] class.
2.  Initialize an object of [TiffOptions][10] class.
3.  Convert the PSD image to a TIFF file using the [Save][11] method.

The code snippet below shows how to convert a PSD image to a TIFF image programmatically in C#:

## Convert PSD to TIFF Image with Compression in C# {#section3}

You can control a PSD file to a TIFF image by specifying different options. For example, the palette, photometric, or compression properties for the output TIFF file. The below steps demonstrate how to convert a PSD image to a TIFF image with compression:

1.  Load the input PSD image with the [Image][12] class.
2.  Instantiate an object of [TiffOptions][13] class.
3.  Set Compression, Photometric and other options.
4.  Save the output compressed TIFF image.

The following code sample shows how to convert a PSD image to a compressed TIFF image programmatically in C#:
