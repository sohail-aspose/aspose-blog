[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-Java_100.png) We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for Java 16.1.0. In this release, we have included some new features and have also addressed some of reported issues.

## New Features

We have incorporated the much requested feature of setting the default automatic series color for chart. Please visit the documentation article, Setting the Automatic series color for chart series for more details and sample code.

## Resolved Issues

We have fixed several issues including bigger fonts, missing background and wrong bullet points while rendering the presentation to different file formats. Many issues related to loading and saving presentations that earlier resulted in different exceptions includingÂ PptxReadException, IndexOutOfRangeException, ArgumentException and PptxEditException, have also been rectified in this release. We have also fixed the issue pertaining to **joinPortionsWithSameFormatting** method that unifies the contiguous portions of text having same formatting.

The slide cloning support has also been improved by rectifying issues related to cloning the slides with charts. The issue of wrong layout slide applied during slide cloning has also been rectified in this release.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please visit the documentation article Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for Java 16.1.0 for further reference.
