We have recently released a new version of Aspose.Network for .NET 6.4. In this version, we added support for new features available via Exchange Web Services like manage inbox rules, user configuration, conversation items and get mail tips. All these features require MS Exchange Server 2010 SP1.

We also provided some other new features and bug fixes in this release. For download and release notes, please [click here][2].
