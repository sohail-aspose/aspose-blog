**Australia, Sydney – June 25, 2008 –** Aspose.Slides for JasperReports is an external exporter for JasperReports. Furthermore, it is the first product on the market that gives developers working with JasperReports the power to export reports directly from JasperReports to Microsoft PowerPoint PPT and PPS file formats.   
  
Aspose.Slides for JasperReports joins Aspose's existing family of Aspose.Slides products: Aspose.Slides for .NET and Aspose.Slides for Java are both well-established products. Considering the success of these products, and the repeated customer requests for a JasperReports exporter, it was logical to develop Aspose.Slides for JasperReports.

“_Being able to export a report from an application makes it even more useful_,” says Ben Li, Team Leader of Aspose Sydney. “_Business users ask developers first for an interface for creating reports and then for a way of saving that report out to another format. They want to create reports and then present them to management or save them for reference._” Aspose.Slides for JasperReports makes this both possible and easy. Instead of spending long hours developing and testing a component to output a JasperReports report to a presentation or image format, developers can now use Aspose.Slides to turn a report into directly into a presentation.  
  
Further JasperReport exporters are planned and will be released later this year.
