We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.BarCode for SSRS 6.2.0. In this release, we have fixed a few internal errors. These errors were impacting the barcode control preview mode inside the Visual Studio development for reporting services.

This new release also enhances QR code character encoding limits. The Aspose.BarCode API now generates QR codes with 4,296 symbols correctly. This release also includes the most recent internal improvements.

To view a complete list of new features, fixes and enhancements [download the new release of Aspose.BarCode for SSRS][1].
