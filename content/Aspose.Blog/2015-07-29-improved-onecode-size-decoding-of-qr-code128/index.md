We are pleased to announce the new release version of [Aspose.BarCode for Java][1] 7.0.0. It covers both encoding and decoding perspectives. In reference of OneCode barcode encoding, previously users were changing code text but it was generating only a fix sized barcode picture, but now it is not so. In general, the barcode size also depends on the code text. However, users can re-size barcode picture as already narrated in this help topic: [Generate Barcode Using Custom Width Support][2]

The Code128 and QR recognition engines have been improved slightly. In the recent release version, we have also fixed some recognition failure cases. Please check a list of fixed issues below:

*   Fixed: Same size OneCode barcodes are being generated.
*   Fixed: Can't recognize QR barcode from the PNG image.
*   Fixed: Can't recognize small Code128 barcodes.
*   Fixed: Code128 document not recognized from a scanned document.
