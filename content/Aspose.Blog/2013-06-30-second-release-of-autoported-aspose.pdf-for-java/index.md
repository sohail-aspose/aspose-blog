[![Aspose.Pdf for Java logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/aspose-Pdf-for-Java_100.png)We are very much excited to announce the second release of the autoported version of Aspose.Pdf for Java. This release contains fixes for issues that customers have encountered evaluating the first release. Some customer faced problems when migrating their code base from Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java to the autoported Aspose.Pdf for Java. This release is more stable than the earlier release and illustrates our commitment to delivering robust components.

## Single JAR file

In the first release, we provided two JAR files: one for legacy Aspose.Pdf for Java and the second JAR containing the new autoported Aspose.Pdf for Java component. In this version, we have introduced a single JAR which contains the classes and packages of both previous JARs. So now you only need to use **aspose.pdf-new-4.1.0.jar** in your solution and to access all the classes and enumerations from both packages.

Please visit the following link for further details on what's fixed in [Aspose.Pdf for Java 4.1.0][2].
