## Pivot Tables Rendering

Support for pivot tables in Excel (97-2010) spreadsheets has been in Aspose.Cells for a long time. We are continuously improving this module with every release of the product. With this release, we've added support for the GETPIVOTDATA function. We have also enhanced some pivot table options, e.g. DataDisplayFormat, AutoShowCount, Data Filtering etc. We have fixed the compatibility problems and other issues regarding pivot tables for different Excel file formats.

## Miscellaneous

We have improved the performance of Aspose.Cells formula calculation engine further. We have enhanced advanced conditional formatting rendering options. Rendering auto-shapes are improved while converting to PDF. Moreover, we have enhanced reading charts from ODS files. There are some other fixes and enhancements too. You'll see a full list of fixes and enhancements from the list on [the download page][3].
