We are pleased to share the release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET 8.3.0. This month’s release includes new functionality, enhancements and other improvements that include a number of bug fixes. Specifically, it includes a fix that lead to API performance while adding resource assignments. For further details about what is new and fixed, please visit our [product download page][2].

# New Features & Enhancements

This month’s release includes the following new features.

**Export to Primavera MPX format**

Aspose.Tasks for .NET already supports importing/exporting project data from/to various Primavera formats like Primavera XML and XER formats. This month’s release further enhances this feature of exporting project data to Primavera MPX format, which can be achieved using the SaveFileFormat.MPX enumerator option. This further extends the range of file format support of Aspose.Tasks API.

**Capability to set Start Date for Gantt chart view**

Aspose.Tasks API provides a rich set of options for rendering Gantt chart. This month’s release enhances the capability to set Start date of Gantt chart view while saving the project data back to MPP file format. This can be configured by setting the TimescaleStart property of _Prj_ class to the desired date time. Howeve,r if the saved file is opened in Microsoft Project in maximized window mode, then the timescale start date will not match. More Info

**Performance Improvement**

The last version of Aspose.Tasks for .NET did have some issues with overall API performance while adding resource assignments. The time taken by the recalculations was significantly larger as compared to the equivalent code execution using Microsoft Interop. This issue has been fixed now and the performance is at par with its equivalent APIs now.

# Other Improvements

This month’s release also includes a number of bug fixes that further ads to the overall improvement of the API.  These include issues related to summary tasks, MPP to XML conversion, actual start dates of tasks, and extended attributes.
