[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/06/aspose_slides-for-java1.png)[![][2]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/08/docx4j.png)We've created a new release of the Aspose for Java comparison to Pptx4j. The new release, [Missing Features of Pptx4j in Aspose 1.1][3], shows a number of Aspose.Slides features missing in Pptx4j.

The source code of these examples is freely hosted on popular social coding sites like [CodePlex][4], [GitHub][5], [Bitbucket][6] and [SourceForge][7].

This release contains a few new examples of features that are only available in Aspose APIs and not in Pptx4j API of Project Docx4j and related tools.

## What's New

*   [Clone PPT Slide][8].
*   [Clone slide to specified position][9].
*   [Shadow effects on slide text][10].
*   [Apply password protection][11].
*   [Apply protection with property access][12].

## Existing Samples

*   [Add audio frame to slide][13].
*   [Convert to PDF][14].
*   [Manage slide transition][15].
*   [Manage Smart Art][16].
*   [Slide thumbnails][17].
*   [Working with slide comments][18].

There is much more yet to come and many more examples with documentation are available at Aspose Docs. Keep visiting us.
