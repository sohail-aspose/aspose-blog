Here is a next release with improvements and fixes to DOCX import (which is still in Beta) and others.

**Notes**

*   A great new feature is support for picture bullets. It was highly demanded by users. Picture bullets are custom images used for bullets instead of text bullets or numbers. Picture bullets are now supported in DOC, RTF, WordML, DOCX and export to PDF formats in Aspose.Words.
*   An important fix for defect 4091 where hyperlink targets in imported DOCX files were altered by Aspose.Words.
*   Bear with us as we continue to develop and test the Office OpenXML (DOCX) import module. It still remains "Beta", but it will become a release very soon. In this version we have tested document properties, fields, footnotes, headers/footers, paragraphs, runs and sections. There is still lists, styles, tables and shapes to check and finalize.
