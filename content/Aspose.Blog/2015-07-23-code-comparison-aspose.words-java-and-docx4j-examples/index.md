Project Aspose Java for Docx4j shows how different tasks can be performed using Aspose Java APIs in comparison with Docx4j. Aspose Java for Docx4j also covers the features that are only available in Aspose.Words Java API but not in Docx4j.

This new release, [Aspose.Words Java vs Docx4j v1.2][1], shows a number of new code comparison examples of features that are available in both Aspose.Words Java API and in Docx4j while dealing with Microsoft Word and Apache OpenOffice Writer documents.

The source code of these examples is freely hosted on [GitHub][2] and running examples are also available to download on [CodePlex][3].
