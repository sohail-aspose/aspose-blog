Hi all. In my previous post Aspose.Words for Java stood at 679 unit tests failing and now there are only 437 tests to fix. That is 242 tests fixed over about 10 working days.

CodePorting, the tool we're using to port the code, speeds up the porting process so we can focus on fixing failing tests. If things continue at this speed we need another 18 working days and a completely autoported Aspose.Words for Java will be unit tests green and ready to go into the next stage.

This means early-February we will start user acceptance testing andÂ packaging Aspose.Words for Java for the long awaited V10.0 release.
