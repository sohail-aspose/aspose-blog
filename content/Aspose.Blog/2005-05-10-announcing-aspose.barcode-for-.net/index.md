**May 10, 2005 - Sydney, Australia** \- Barcodes are everywhere. Originally used mostly in retail, they have become a popular choice for tracking or sharing information in all kinds of industries. From stock control in clothes shops and supermarkets, to tracking parcels and even containers. We all encounter barcodes several times each day. They are so common, we hardly think about them.

Aspose have introduced Aspose.BarCode for .NET, a class library for recognizing and adding barcodes to documents in .NET applications. We foresee that the very first application it will be used for is document management. We know from the many customer requests that we have seen that our users will use barcodes for many other applications too.

To try Aspose.BarCode, [download a free trial from our website][1]. We welcome comments and feature requests in our support forums where the very people who design the product is on hand to help our users. User feedback determines the direction of our products' future development. We will continue to add to the list of barcode symbologies that Aspose.BarCode supports and are interested to hear what else you need it to do.

Aspose.BarCode joins a growing library of file management products from Aspose. Only last year we published:

*   Aspose.Slides for .NET, a class library for working with Microsoft PowerPoint presentations in .NET applications.
*   Aspose.Tasks for .NET, a class library for working with Microsoft Project files in .NET applications.
