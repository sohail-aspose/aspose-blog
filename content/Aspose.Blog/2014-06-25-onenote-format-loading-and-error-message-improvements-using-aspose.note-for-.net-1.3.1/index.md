[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We are pleased to announce a hotfix release of [Aspose.Note for .NET][2] 1.3.1. In this new build, we have fixed two issues. The first one was about loading an old version of OneNote formats into the Document object. Currently, the Aspose.Note API does not support older versions. We list all supported formats in the product overview and keep this page updated. However, Â a user faced null reference exception message. These types of messages can be a source of frustration so we fixed it. Now, users get a proper message when loading an old version of OneNote documents.

The second issue was about an invalid operation exception message. This error message occurs when the state of one or more objects determines whether an operation can be performed. A user got this message when loading a supported OneNote document. We have fixed this issue too.

To view a complete list of API features and try the API at your end, please visit the following page and [download the latest version of Aspose.Note for .NET][3]. If you need any help, please feel free to ask in the [Aspose.Note forum][4]. For more details, please visit the Aspose.Note for .NET documentation.
