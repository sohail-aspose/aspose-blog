[Aspose.PDF for Java][1] 3.7.0 is now available for download. In this latest version, we have improved the replace text feature. The text replacement using 'Replace All' scope has been enhanced. We have also improved the replace text performance.

New features of manipulating text within a specified rectangular area have been introduced in this release. You can set a rectangle using setRectangle method and then call the replaceText method of PdfContentEditor class to replace text in the specified area. You can also update the text properties, using TextProperties class, within a rectangle. Text can also be retrieved from a specified location on a particular page using getTextInRectangle method. The code snippets to understand the usage of these new features can be found in the following help topic: Manipulate Text Inside a Rectangle
