## Spring is here and Aspose is growing!

### Bettering Business - Conquering Lost Details

One common problem we see here at Aspose are orders which have outdated contact details. This can be frustrating for customers because they may miss important mailings regarding maintenance, support or billing issues. Such problems typically begin when a personal email is provided during a purchase.

A simple solution to this predicament is to use a distribution list when purchasing products. For example, one may setup a group "it.purchases@yourbusiness.com" and have it direct to several people. If one member of the group moves to another position the others still continue to receive information.

Do you have a quick tip for bettering business? If so get in touch, and we may able to highlight you and your idea in a future newsletter.

Many thanks,  
Danny Cooper, Aspose Texas Team Leader
