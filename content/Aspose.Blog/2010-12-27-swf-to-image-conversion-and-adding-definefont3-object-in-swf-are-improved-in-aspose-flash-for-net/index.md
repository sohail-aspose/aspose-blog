We have published the new release of Aspose.Flash for .NET. In Aspose.Flash for .NET 3.5.0, we have improved the SWF to image rendering mechanism to handle various file structures. We have also enhanced the feature of adding new fonts using DefineFont3 object.  
  
You can see the changes and download the latest version from the [Aspose.Flash for .NET download section][1].
