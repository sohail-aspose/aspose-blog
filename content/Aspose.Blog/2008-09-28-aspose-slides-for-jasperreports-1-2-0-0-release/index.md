What's New:  

*   Improved integration with JasperServer. See documentation for integration details.
*   Implemented 3 different ways of licensing exporter.
*   Possibility to define individual template presentation for each report or change default template for all reports.

Fixed:  

*   Possible exception in case of image referenced by URL is not available.
*   Too strong obfuscation which did not allow using exporter parameters with JasperServer.
