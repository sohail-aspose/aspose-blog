The latest release simplified the Aspose Maven dependencies integration with the extended Spring's PetClinic Web Application or Any Maven based project through **[Aspose Cloud Maven Repository][1]** inclusion in the project maven pom.xml, as opposed to the previous approach (in v1.0), which first created the local maven repository for the Aspose Maven dependencies to be specified in pom.xml configuration file. This also dramatically decreased the project size to the only 2mb from previously some 48 MB size because of the removal of local Aspose maven dependencies.
