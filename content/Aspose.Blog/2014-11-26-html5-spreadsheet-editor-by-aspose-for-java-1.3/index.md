## Resizable Columns

The 1.3 release of the Editor allows users to resize columns. Learn more about resizing columns.

## Colors

In 1.2 we introduced rendering of cell formatting. But the colors were not properly rendered. In 1.3 we have fixed those issues and improved the **rendering of both background and foreground colors** of cell.

## Rows and Columns

Adding and deleting rows was introduced with the first release. 1.3 features add/remove columns too. Learn more about adding and removing rows and columns.

## Rename Sheets

Users can now rename sheets just by changing the name and pressing ENTER.

## User Interface Improvements

In 1.3, the user interface has been improved. Extra spaces around UI elements has been removed. UI does not get disturbed when browser window is resized. The overall layout is more compact, and looks more appealing when embedded into websites.  Now the inline-editor does not hide behind adjacent cell.
