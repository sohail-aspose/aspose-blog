[Aspose][1], a file formats API provider, has decided to rename Aspose.Cells for Android to Aspose.Cells for Java.Android. Aspose.Cells for Java.Android is a subset component that includes all the important and useful features present in its native [Aspose.Cells for Java][2]. The Android API has now become more robust, scalable and feature rich component than before. Android developers will be able to utilize high-fidelity file format conversions to and from XLS, XLSX, XLSM, SpreadsheetML, CSV, Tab Delimited, HTML, MHTML and OpenDocument Spreadsheet. They will have full programmatic access through a rich APIs set to all MS Excel document objects and formattings that allows to create, modify, extract, copy, merge, and replace spreadsheet content. With Aspose.Cells for Java.Android, developers can export data, format spreadsheets to the most granular level, create, manipulate and render charts, apply and calculate complex formulas efficiently and much more.  The component now supports the following most demanding features regarding file formats and conversions on Android:

*   Rendering Workbook to PDF, XPS, ODS and SVG formats

## Important to Know

Please note, The APIs structure still remains the same, so it won't disturb our existing clients who can still use the APIs without any changes in the code. Currently, we have renamed Aspose.Cells for Android Wiki space to Aspose.Cells for Java.Android Wiki Conf. Docs. In near future, we will be using one common JAVA Docs (i.e., [Aspose.Cells for Java][3] for Aspose.Cells for Java.Android as well, we will soon revamp the Wiki Conf. Docs accordingly. We have also changed Aspose.Cells for Android node to [Aspose.Cells for Java.Android][4] node in Downloads section. Moreover, the Aspose.Cells for Java.Android product pages will be soon updated.
