**November 6, 2004 - Texas, USA -** Aspose has its headquarters in Australia and has teams in other parts of the world. To extend our business further we have decided to start a team in Texas, USA.

The Texas team expands our sales and marketing capacity and brings new skills to the team. Aspose's development teams work hard and are very productive. The Texas team will help us get the products that we develop out to a wider market. It is exciting to see a new team join the international family that is Aspose, and lend their perspective and experience to our joint efforts.

Danny Cooper, the Aspose Texas Team Leader, says: _"I am honored to join the Aspose family, and look forward to helping grow awareness of our file management tools within the development community."_ Danny is a software entrepreneur with an established history in technology and promotion.

Aspose is looking for talent all over the world. We want to work with the best, not the best that we can find locally. Our ongoing search for the right people is what has lead us to expand onto another continent. We now have a presence on four of seven continents: Australia, where it all started, Asia, Europe and North America. The future of the company is bright: there are no borders to success.
