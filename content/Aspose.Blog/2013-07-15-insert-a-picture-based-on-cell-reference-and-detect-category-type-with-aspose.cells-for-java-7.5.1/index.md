We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Cells for Java 7.5.1. In this release, we supported [inserting pictures based on cell references in a worksheet][1]. The data in the picture is reflected accordingly when you update the source cells range. You can now also detect a category numberâ€™s formatting type via the Cell.getNumberCategoryType() method. We have fixed an issue regarding JDK1.7 versions for [chart to image][2], [sheet to image][3], and [Excel to PDF rendering][4].

Several other important issues and exceptions have been addressed. For example, issues around Microsoft Excel file formats (reading/writing), rendering PivotTables, rendering charts, manipulating worksheets, and rendering to PDF format have been resolved.

To see a complete list of enhancements and fixes and to download Aspose.Cells for Java 7.5.1, please visit the [download page][5].
