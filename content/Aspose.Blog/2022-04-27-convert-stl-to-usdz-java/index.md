An [STL][1] file describes the surface geometry of 3D objects and they are commonly used 3D printing, rapid prototyping, etc. While the [USDZ][2] files are getting popular to be used in augmented reality scenarios. They are the uncompressed ZIP archives that contain Universal Scene Description information. In certain cases, you may need to convert an STL file to USDZ format. According to such scenarios, this article explains how to convert an STL file to USDZ format programmatically in Java.

## Convert STL to USDZ File Programmatically in Java {#section2}

You can convert an STL file to USDZ with the steps listed below:

1.  Load the input STL file using the [Scene][8] class object.
2.  Create an instance of [UsdSaveOptions][9] class.
3.  Convert STL file to USDZ format.

The code snippet below demonstrates how to convert an STL file to a USDZ file in Java:
