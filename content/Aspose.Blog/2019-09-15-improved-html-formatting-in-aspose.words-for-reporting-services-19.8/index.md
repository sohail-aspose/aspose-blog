We are pleased to announce the new release of Aspose.Words for Reporting Services i.e. 19.8. We have upgraded this release to Aspose.Words for .NET 19.8. You may know that this product uses Aspose.Words for .NET as a codebase. So, the enhancements and features of Aspose.Words for .NET are used in this product while exporting RDL/RDLC.

We have also improved HTML formatting for output documents in this release. In [HTML formatting][1], when there are several "style" attributes, for example:

<p style="color:blue;text-align:center" style="font-style:italic">This is a paragraph.

The second style was ignored in old versions of this product while exporting RDL/RDLC. Starting from this release, you can use second style in HTML tags.

We suggest you please check the [release notes][2] for more detail. You can download the latest release of Aspose.Words for Reporting Services 19.8 from the following link:
