Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

Please welcome **Aspose.Editor -** our latest addition to the Aspose components family.

Aspose.Editor is a new breed of word processor control for Windows Forms .NET. A specially crafted page layout engine displays, edits and prints pages a lot like Microsoft Word, but inside your application. The native format for documents in Aspose.Editor is WordprocessingML with a unique feature of roundtripping even for complex documents. When used together with Aspose.Words (purchased separately), opening and editing of DOC and HTML documents is also possible.

Aspose.Editor is written completely in C#, CLS compliant and contains only safe managed code. Microsoft Word is not required in order to use Aspose.Editor.

Aspose.Editor is available for download in the Downloads section.

Free technical support is provided in the Aspose.Editor Support Forums.

In order to celebrate the release of Aspose.Editor we are offering a special introductory price of $299! To make things even better we are also providing two years of updates at no extra cost. This is a limited time offer, so act now and add this powerful new component to your development toolbox.

Over the next few days more information will be added to the website including detailed feature descriptions, screenshots and online API reference.

Thank you for your continued interest in Aspose products.
