We updated our documentation of Aspose.BarCode for JasperReports component and added a new technical article. In this article, we first designed a report using iReport plug-in for Netbeans and added an image on it. Later on we used JasperReports engine SDK and Aspose.BarCode for JasperReports library to insert barcode images in the report.

The technical article is uploaded atÂ http://www.aspose.com/documentation/jasperreports-exporters/aspose.barcode-for-jasperreports/design-reports-using-ireport-and-render-barcode-images.html. For downloading the iReport demo, visit [http://www.aspose.com/community/files/67/jasperreports-exporters/aspose.barcode-for-jasperreports/entry196823.aspx][1]. The latest trial version of Aspose.BarCode for JasperReports can be downloaded from [http://www.aspose.com/community/files/67/jasperreports-exporters/aspose.barcode-for-jasperreports/category1327.aspx][2].
