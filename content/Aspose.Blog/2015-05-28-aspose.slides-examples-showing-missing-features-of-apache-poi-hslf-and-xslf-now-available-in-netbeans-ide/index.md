## Aspose Java for Apache POI

Project [Aspose Java for Apache POI][4] shows how different functionalities can be achieved using Aspose Java APIs in comparison with Apache POI. In addition, Aspose has many more features than Apache POI to fulfil developer requirements. To highlight some of these enhanced features of Aspose APIs, following are few modules of examples showing features that are only available in Aspose but missing in Apache POI.

*   Missing Features of Apache POI SS available in Aspose.Cells.
*   Missing Features of Apache POI SL available in Aspose.Slides.
*   Missing Features of Apache POI WP available in Aspose.Words.
*   Missing Features of Apache POI HSMF available in Aspose.Email.

After this release following comparison and missing examples are now available in Aspose Project from version 2.3 and onwards.

#### Comparison Examples

*   [Aspose.Words vs Apache POI WP][5].
*   [Aspose.Slides vs Apache POI SL][6].
*   [Aspose.Cells vs Apache POI SS][7].
*   [Aspose.Email vs Apache POI HSMF][8].

#### Missing Examples

*   [Missing Features of Apache POI HWPF and XWPF in Aspose.Words][9].
*   [Missing Features of Apache POI HSMF in Aspose.Email][10].
*   [Missing Features of Apache POI HSLF and XSLF in Aspose.Slides][11].

With this integration you don't need to manually download the [Aspose Java APIs code for missing features of Apache POI framework][12] as they are now available through the plugin's Aspose New Example wizard within NetBeans IDE.

## Source Code Available

Aspose Project Wizard for NetBeans is open source and its source code is available on below mentioned major social coding websites. Developers can extend the functionality if they want or learn from it to make their own plugins.
