We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Email for .NET 18.7][1]. This month’s release includes a new feature and several enhancements to the API’s feature set. It also includes several bug fixes reported with the previous version of the API that add to the overall API stability. For a complete list of what is new and fixed, please visit the [release notes][2] section of API documentation.

## HTTP Proxy in Email Clients using C#

Being famous in the market for email communication, Aspose.Email’s emailing clients let you work with popular protocols including SMTP, POP3 and IMAP. The earlier versions of the API supported Socks Proxy. This month’s release further enhances this capability by providing support for HTTP Proxy.  You can now use the emailing clients i.e. [POP3][3], [IMAP][4] and [SMTP][5] with HTTP proxy.

## Convert Outlook Task to MHTML

We have also supported Outlook’s Task conversion to MHTML and produce [MailMessage like output][6]. The MhtSaveOptions’ FormatTemplates lets you specify additional options to set the output format in desired format.

## Unified Method for Fetching Outlook Items

This month’s release also enhances the functionality of fetching Outlook items from Exchange server. All old methods like FetchContact, FetchMessage, FetchNote, etc. have been replaced with a single unified method named FetchItem. This allows to use the common method for fetching all types of items from the Exchange server without worrying for exact match.
