Recently, we added a new article in our "Migration from Office Automation to Aspose" section of Aspose.Network for .NET documentation. In this article, we sent a meeting request to recipients using Outlook Interop and Aspose.Network for .NET and discussed some benefits of using Aspose over Outlook Interop.
