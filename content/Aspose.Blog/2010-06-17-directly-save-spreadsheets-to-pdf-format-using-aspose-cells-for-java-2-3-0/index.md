We have released Aspose.Cells for Java v2.3.0 for the users.

In this version, we have supported direct conversion of spreadsheets to PDF files without using Aspose.Pdf for Java. We have also supported EMF image format for Chart-to-Image feature. Moreover, we have made some improvements regarding certain operations, e.g Worksheetâ€™s Copy, Reading ODS files, Reading XLS template files and Reading Charts' Gradient Fill effects.

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
