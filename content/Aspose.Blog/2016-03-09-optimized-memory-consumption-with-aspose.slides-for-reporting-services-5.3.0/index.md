We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 5.3.0.

In this release, we have enhanced the support for image rendering in Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services. The problem of text overflowing has also been fixed in this release.

We have improved the memory consumption while rendering a report to a presentation. This optimal memory consumption ensures there are no OutOfMemory Exceptions during rendering operation.

We have resolved issues related to height of table rows and width of table columns, which results in improved rendering of the data in a table. Another issue which was occurring while installing earlier versions of Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services in SharePoint integrated environment, has also been fixed. All of these enhancements and bug fixes result in improved rendering of reports to presentations.

To see a complete list of fixes and to download Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 5.3.0, please visit the [download page][1].
