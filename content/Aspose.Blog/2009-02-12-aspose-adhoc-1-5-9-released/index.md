Dear Customers,

We've released Aspose.AdHoc v1.5.9!

It contains most recent bug fixes. Moreover, now download package contains two versions of the Aspose.AdHoc, built under **Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1** and **2.0** so that you can use any appropriate version corresponding to your needs.

Also installer supports silent upgrade now, so you don't need to uninstall previous version of component manually before installing new one.
