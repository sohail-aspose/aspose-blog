[![Aspose.Cells logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/05/aspose.cells-logo2.jpg)We are happy to present the release of Aspose.Cells for .NET 7.3.4. In this release, we have provided support for OpenOffice 3D charts. The SmartMarker grouping data feature is improved and we have included more custom options for subtotals. The find and replace feature has been enhanced. There is also an improvement in the Formula Calculation engine of Aspose.Cells and we have improved performance when reading and rendering Microsoft Excel files.

This release is a maintenance release where several important issues have been fixed. Many important issues around reading and writing spreadsheets (XLS, XLSX etc.), rendering PivotTables and exporting to PDF have been resolved. Issues pertaining to charts and the formula calculation engine have also been corrected in this release.

We have fixed a few issues in the Grid controls (GridDesktop and GridWeb) provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET regarding formatting, rendering and protection.
