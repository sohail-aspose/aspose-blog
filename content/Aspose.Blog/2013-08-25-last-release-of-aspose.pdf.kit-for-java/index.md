The final version of Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java has been released. The component has helped many of our customers to manipulate PDF files on Java. However, the needs of our users have changed and to serve them better and let them both create and manipulate PDF files with a single component, we have merged Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java with Aspose.Pdf for Java. All the Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java classes are now available in the com.aspose.pdf.facades package. We've already shared information about the merge of these two products in blog posts and [Aspose.Pdf for Java release notes][1]. We also announced that we'll discontinue Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java in Q3 2013.

Recently we have published [Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java 4.7.0][2]. This is the last separate version of Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java. From now on,Â all new features, enhancements and bug fixes related to Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java features will be introduced in Aspose.Pdf for Java.

Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java releases will be available for download for one year from the date of their release and then they will be removed. Therefore, we strongly suggest that you migrate your code to latest release of Aspose.Pdf for Java. If you have any issues, or questions, please post queries in the [Aspose.Pdf product family support forum][3].
