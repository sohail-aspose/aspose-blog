# docx4j



{{< figure align=center src="images/docx4j.png" alt="">}}


docx4j is an open-source (ASLv2) Java library for creating and manipulating Microsoft Open XML (Word DOCX, Powerpoint PPTX, and Excel XLSX) files.

It is similar to Microsoft's OpenXML SDK, but for Java. docx4j uses JAXB to create in-memory object representation.

Its emphasis is on power: if the file format supports it, you can do it with docx4j. But first, you'll need to take the time to understand JAXB, and the Open XML file structure

docx4j was created by Plutext Pty Ltd in 2008 - using OpenXML4J for the OPC piece. Plutext still drives the project, but since then docx4j has benefited from contributions from many individuals. The contributors are listed in docx4j's pom.xml.

The above information and more are available on [docx4java.org][2].
