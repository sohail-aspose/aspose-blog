There are heaps of commercial and free difference tools available. Only few of them can find moved blocks of lines. At the moment I'm only aware of WinDiff, WinMerge and Compare It. However I need to be able to "jump" between move source and destination and only Compare It allows it. I also need to generate a report that distinguishes moved lines from simple insertions or deletions. None of the tools do that. Is that a very weird requirement?  

If you know a good tool that can reliably find moved lines and generate a report let me know, it will be appreciated.
