Two new products and a busy month ahead

Hi there! I hope 2011 is shaping up for you and that you are managing to keep to your New Year's resolutions.

Last month my colleague Danny shared that we had a lot of exciting plans in store for 2011 – he wasn't joking! January was a busy month for us and February is looking equally productive.

Some highlights – this month we've released:

*   Aspose.Words for .NET V9.6 with some fantastic new features,
*   a new product in our JasperReports line: Aspose.Pdf for JasperReports,
*   and an impressive addition to our SharePoint product family: Aspose.Network for SharePoint.

As always, we'd love you to download and try our software. You can [download fully functional trial versions from the downloads section of our website][1].

Over the next couple of months we'll be making some changes to Aspose.PDF for .NET. Aspose.PDF for .NET v. 6.0 will be a major upgrade and we'll introduce a whole host of new features that we know will impress new and existing customers alike. Aspose.PDF for .NET is already the leading PDF component in its class and the changes we have planned will secure its position for several years to come. You'll see some preview releases of Aspose.PDF v. 6.0 for .NET appearing over the coming months.

Thanks for your interest in our products. We're always keen to hear from our users: if there are any topics you'd like to discuss with us, please get in touch. We'd love to speak to you.

Many thanks,

John Owens, Aspose Scotland Team Leader

Migration Tip - Creating a Pie Chart with Aspose.Cells for .NET

Do you need to produce charts in Excel programmatically? There is more than one way to achieve this task: you can use VSTO or you can use Aspose.Cells. This migration tip shows both methods using C# and VB. The scenario creates a file, populates it with data and then adds a chart to the workbook. The same process can be used for other chart types too.
