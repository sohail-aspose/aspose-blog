[![Aspose.Diagram for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/06/aspose-Diagram-for-net_100.png)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Diagram for .NET 3.7.0. With this release, developers can get a page by its name. Previously, it wasn't possible to find the exact page ID, and then get the page.  It is now simple and easy. Now, just pass the exact page name.  Although, users can practice either page ID or name: the PageCollection.GetPage method allows you to do that. You can find the details of this feature in the following help topic: Get a Page Object from Visio Drawing

Visio drawing export to HTML and PDF formats have now enhanced. The enhanced areas grip shape’s hyperlink redirection, the page number fields protection in the sense of accuracy and quality display, sequence of pages and user inputs (text, data) of custom reusable shapes.  All improvements are based on customer feedback.

Various other developments have been made to improve the overall performance and quality. Through these developments, the retrieval rate of user fields from VSDX format is now much better. Another valuable fix is to handle stack overflow error when laying out shapes in the compact tree style. This release also includes a number other bug fixes.
