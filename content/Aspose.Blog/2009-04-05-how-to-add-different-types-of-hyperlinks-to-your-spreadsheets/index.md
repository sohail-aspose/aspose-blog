You can add all three types of hyperlinks to your spreadsheets using Aspose.Cells API:

1.  URL (world wide web) link
2.  Internal link
3.  External or file link

We create a demo video for the users. In this video, we create a simple Windows application to exercise how the three types of hyperlinks (mentioned above) can be added.
