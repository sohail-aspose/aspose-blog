We are pleased to announce that Aspose.OCR for Java 17.11 is now available for public use. In this release, the OCR engine has been upgraded which resulted in the overall high performance of the API. Furthermore, some issues incurring in API have also been addressed.

## Other Enhancements

The following enhancements have been introduced in this release.

*   Binary Classification has been introduced for better OCR recognition.
*   OCR network implemented in Player under our main OCR component to achieve better performance.

As all the enhancements are internal to the API, so there are no public API changes from the end user’s point of view and the features can be used readily with this new version.
