[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-Java_100.png) We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Java 8.4.0. This is a maintenance and a much stable release in which we have resolved many issues reported by our customers.

## Fixes and Improvements

We have introduced a mechanism for calculating the angle for a connector line shape added to a slide that can be helpful when working with connectors. For more information about the feature, please visit the Calculating Connector Line Angle topic.

We have provided improved rendering support in this new release. Issues related to missing WMF, EMF and other images in exported PDF have been resolved. We have also addressed text rendering issues for exported PDF and thumbnails. Many text rendering, improper hyperlinks, improper vertical text and bullet rendering issues have been addressed.C hart rendering has also been improved and issues related to missing charts, wrong legend and chart axis have been rectified for generated PDF and thumbnails

Presentation access and saving issues have also been taken in to account. For this many issues related to accessing presentation have been resolved that earlier resulted in NullPointer and NullReference exceptions.
