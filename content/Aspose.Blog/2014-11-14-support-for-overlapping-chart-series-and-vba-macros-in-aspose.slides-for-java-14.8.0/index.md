[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-Java_100.png) We're pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for Java 14.8.0. This is a major product release where we have included support for some long awaited new features. We have also rectified a number of rendering issues that have been reported for exported PDF, HTML and slide thumbnails in earlier versions.

## New Features

We have introduced support for overlapping chart series in this release. With this feature, it is now possible to overlap chart series over one another. For more details about this feature, please visit the documentation article Adding Chart Series Overlap for Charts.

The long awaited support for managing VBA macros in presentations has been included in this release. Now you can add or access existing VBA macros in a presentation using Aspose.Slides. To get familiar with this feature, please visit the documentation article Adding VBA Macros in Presentation.

We have also improved the shape thumbnail generation support by including a new enumerator that generates the shape thumbnail as per its appearance. Please visit the documentation article Generating a Shape Thumbnail in Bound of Shape's Appearance for further information about this feature.

Working with text has also been improved in this release. Now, if two consecutive text portions belonging to any text frame paragraph have same formatting, they will be merged into a single portion to avoid confusion about the number of portions in a paragraph.

## Resolved Issues

We have also made a leap towards presentation rendering by rectifying many rendering issues that appeared in exported PDF, HTML and slide thumbnails. Mainly, this release has fixed issues to do with rendering chart entities, tables, text and bullets inside text frames. Details about the rendering issues can be found in the release notes for Aspose.Slides for Java 14.8.0 available in the download section. Please visit the [download page to see the release notes for Aspose.Slides for Java 14.8.0][2].

We have also rectified issues that appeared when accessing, saving and rendering presentations to PDF, HTML or slide thumbnails, which resulted in different exceptions like NullReference, ArgumentException, IndexOutOfRange in previous releases.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please visit the documentation article Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for Java 14.8.0 for further reference.
