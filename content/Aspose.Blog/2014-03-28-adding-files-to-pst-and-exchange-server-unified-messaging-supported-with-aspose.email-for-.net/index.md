[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/03/aspose-Email-for-net_1001.png)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Email for .NET 4.0.0 which includes a number of new features, enhancements and bug fixes.

Microsoft Outlook allows you to add documents to a Microsoft Outlook data file in addition to store items such as messages, tasks, contacts, calendar items and journal entries. This month’s release of Aspose.Email for .NET provides the same capability of adding files to PST folders with just a couple of lines of code.

This month’s release also introduces a new feature for working with unified messaging from Exchange Server 2010. At present, the API supports retrieving unified messaging configuration information, initiating outbound calls, retrieving phone call information and disconnecting a phone call.

## Enhancements

This month’s release also brings enhancements to some key functionalities of the API as listed below:

*   Adding reminder information to MapiTask: add reminder information to an Outlook task and save to disc.
*   Updating contact information using EWS: retrieve and update contact information using Exchange Web Service (EWS).
*   Pop3Client - list messages asynchronously with MailQuery: Aspose.Email’s Pop3Client already provided the feature of listing messages asynchronously from a mailbox. This month’s release further enhances the functionality for listing messages asynchronously with specifying MailQuery parameter
*   ImapClient – listing messages recursively: the IMAP protocol supports listing messages recursively from a mailbox. Aspose.Email for .NET now provides the feature of listing messages recursively by specifying the recursive parameter in the ListMessages method.
*   This release of Aspose.Email also enhances the API’s EWSClient for working in a thread-safe environment.

In addition, this month’s release includes a number of bug fixes as reported by our customers which further improves the overall functionality of the API. For further details on what is new and fixed, please refer to the [product download page][2].
