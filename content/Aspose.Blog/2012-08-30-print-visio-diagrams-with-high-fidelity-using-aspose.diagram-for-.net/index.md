[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/06/aspose.diagram-logo2.jpg)Aspose.Diagram for .NET 2.6.0 has been released. We are pleased to announce that starting from this version, printing diagrams is fully supported. You can easily print all or specified pages of a document with just a few lines of code. Read about printing a document on a server via the XpsPrint API for more details.

The  Aspose.Diagram for .NET API provides the handy [Diagram.Print][2] method whose overloads allow you to print a document using various different options with just one line of code. You can choose to print using the [default settings][3], print to a specific [printer by name][4] and even set printing options such as [printing only a specific page range][5].

To get a list of all the new features and fixes in Aspose.Diagram for .NET 2.6,  [go to the Aspose.Diagram download page][6].
