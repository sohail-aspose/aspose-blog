We are happy to announce the release of a new version of Aspose.Network for .NET v6.1. This version now supports reading OST files. OST files are used by Microsoft Outlook connected to an Exchange Server to store the emails, contacts and calendars locally. We also added some new features related to Exchange/FTP Servers and fixed some bugs.
