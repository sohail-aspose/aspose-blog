[![Aspose.Slides for SharePoint logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/aspose-Slides-for-SharePoint_100.png)We are pleased to share the release announcement of Aspose.Slides for SharePoint 17.6.

This release has been developed based on Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.6. Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.6 has some new features including support for presentation slides sections to group slides in presentation. Moreover, the presentation rendering support has also been improved for HTML, PDF, XPS and Tiff with option to include slide comments in exported output. This improved rendering will help in converting presentations to different formats including images, PDF and XPS when using Aspose.Slides for SharePoint.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for SharePoint 17.6 Release Notes][2] for further reference.
