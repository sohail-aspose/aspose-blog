[Aspose.Diagram for Java][1] is an easy-to-use, high-performance and well-documented library that works with VSD, VSDX, VSS, VST, VSX, VTX, VDW and VDX files in Java applications without the need to rely on Microsoft Office Visio®. It allows developers to open files and manipulate the elements of the diagram or create a diagram from scratch and place various elements, from lines and fills, to more complex elements, and then export to VDX, VSX, VTX, XPS, HTML, SVG, SWF, XAML, image or PDF formats.
