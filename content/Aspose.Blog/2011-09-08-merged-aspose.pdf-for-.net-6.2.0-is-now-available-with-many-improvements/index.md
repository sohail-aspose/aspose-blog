Aspose.Pdf for .NET 6.2.0 is now available for download. In this version, we have improved various areas of the component. You'll find all the details of the bug fixes, enhancements and new features introduced in the new version in this blog post.

PDF to image conversion performance has been improved in this version along with enhanced shading while rendering images. Adding images in the PDF file is a common requirement which is supported by Aspose.Pdf for .NET; however, in this version, we have further enhanced image placement feature. The features to extract, replace or delete images are also improved. Setting brightness using TiffSettings class while converting PDF to TIFF image also gives better results with this release.

PDF forms is another area which received special attention of our development team. Various form fields including text box, list box, radio button, check box, multiline text and button are improved. FillImageField and FillField methods' performance is enhanced.

The other areas which were improved in this release include Document class, Page.Contents property, OperatorCollection, PdfFileEditor class, splitting PDF pages, keeping duplicate fields unique on concatenation, PdfViewer class, rendering text, adding image watermark, setting uppper-alpha, circles and squares as unordered list, and HTML to PDF conversion.

We have also introduced a new feature to convert PDF files to Word documents (DOC). You can find all the details and the code snippet in the following help topic: Convert PDF File into DOC Format.

Another important thing which I want to mention in this post is the difference between evaluation and licensed modes of the Aspose.Pdf for .NET. In fact, evaluation mode applies some checks and evaluation messages, that's why the performance might be a little lower than the licensed version. However, you may try the [temporary license][2] to evaluate the component without any limitations.

You may download the latest version from Aspose.Pdf for .NET downloads section.
