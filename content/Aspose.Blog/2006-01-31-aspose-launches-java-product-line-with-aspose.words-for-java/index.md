**Australia, Sydney – January 31, 2006 –** _“When we started,”_ says Ben Li, Team Leader, Aspose Sydney Team, _“we were looking to create useful class libraries and other solutions to help .NET developers work faster. In the four years since we started, we have been successful doing just that. Our products have been so successful that users have asked us to support more platforms. We decided to do as they asked.”_  
  
Ben is talking about the launch of Aspose.Words for Java, the first in a series of components that Aspose are planning for the Java platform. Aspose.Words for .NET is the company’s most successful product to date: a class library that lets developers manipulate and convert popular word processing file formats from within their .NET application without the need for Microsoft Automation. It was an obvious candidate for porting to Java. Most of the features in the .NET product are also available in the Java product: powerful file format conversion and rendering and document control.
