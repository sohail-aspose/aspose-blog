![Aspose.Cells icon][1]

We have released the Aspose.Cells for .NET v5.3.3. In this version, we have made several enhancements including setting a hyperlink’s “target” attribute and rendering checkboxes in HTML conversion. Now, justified alignment is supported in Excel to PDF conversion. We have also made an enhancement regarding compatibility on Mono for PDF conversion. Moreover, we now support STDEV.S formulas. The web control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET now supports to expand/collapse grouped rows on the client as well as on the server side programmatically by providing the relevant APIs. The desktop control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET allows you to customize the names of the active and non-active worksheets regarding formatting in the Grid. There is an enhancement for undo/redo functionality.

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
