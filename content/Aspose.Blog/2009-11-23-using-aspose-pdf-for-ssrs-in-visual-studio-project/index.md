Beside the fact of using [Aspose.Pdf for SSRS][1] in Report Server, you can alsoÂ add Aspose.Pdf rendering extension directly to the Visual Studio 2005 or 2008 Report Designer (Business Intelligence Development Studio). This will enable you to export your reports to PDF documents right in design time, without the need to upload the reports to Report Server first.
