## Java API to Protect PowerPoint Files {#Java-API-to-Protect-PowerPoint-Files}

In order to protect the PowerPoint files, we will use [Aspose.Slides for Java][6]. It is a powerful and feature-rich API for creating, manipulating, and converting PowerPoint files. Furthermore, it lets you protect PowerPoint PPTX/PPT presentations using passwords or digital signatures. You can either [download][7] the API or install it via Maven.

## Protect PowerPoint PPTX with a Password using Java {#Protect-PowerPoint-PPTX-with-a-Password}

The following are the steps to protect a PowerPoint PPTX file with a password using Aspose.Slides for Java.

*   First, load PPTX presentation using [Presentation][8] class.
*   Encrypt presentation with a password using [Presentation.getProtectionManager().encrypt(String)][9] method.
*   Finally, ave the presentation using [Presentation.save(String, SaveFormat)][10] method.

The following code sample shows how to protect a PowerPoint PPTX file using Java.

## Protect PowerPoint Files using Digital Signature using Java {#Protect-PowerPoint-Documents-using-Digital-Signature}

You can also digitally sign PowerPoint PPTX presentations in order to ensure the authenticity of its content. The following are the steps to add a digital signature to a PPTX file.

*   Load PPTX presentation using [Presentation][11] class.
*   Create a new digital signature using [DigitalSignature][12] class.
*   Add comments for signature using [DigitalSignature.setComments(String)][13] method.
*   Digitally sign the PowerPoint presentation using [Presentation.getDigitalSignatures().add(DigitalSignature)][14] method.
*   Save the updated presentation using [Presentation.save(String, SaveFormat)][15] method.

The following code sample shows how to digitally sign PowerPoint presentations using Java.

## Verify Digitally Signed PowerPoint Presentations in Java {#Verify-Digitally-Signed-PowerPoint-Presentations}

In addition to adding digital signatures, you can also verify the existing signatures in a PowerPoint presentation. The following are the steps to verify digital signatures in a PPTX file.

*   Load PPTX presentation using [Presentation][16] class.
*   Loop through each [IDigitalSignature][17] in the collection returned by [Presentation.getDigitalSignatures()][18] method.
*   Check signature's validity using [IDigitalSignature.isValid()][19] method.

The following code sample shows how to verify digital signatures in PowerPoint PPTX files using Java.

## Get a Free API License {#Get-a-Free-API-License}

You can [get a free temporary license][20] in order to try the API without evaluation limitations.

## Conclusion

In this article, you have learned how to protect MS PowerPoint files using Java. In particular, you have seen how to digitally sign or protect PPTX files using a password. Furthermore, you can explore more about the Java presentation manipulation API using [documentation][21].
