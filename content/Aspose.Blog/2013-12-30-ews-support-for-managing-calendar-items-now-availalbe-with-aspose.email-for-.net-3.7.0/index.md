Aspose.Email for .NET 3.7.0 has been released with a number of new features, enhancements and bug fixes.

Aspose.Email’s Exchange Web Service (EWS) client already provides the capability of adding messages as well as creating contacts and tasks. This month’s release further empowers the EWS client by introducing a new feature of creating, updating and deleting calendar items on exchange server. The online article, Working with Calendar items using EWS client, provides a detailed example of this new feature.

Our last month’s release of Aspose.Email for .NET 3.6.0 introduced a new feature of setting reminders to an appointment. This month’s release further extends this functionality to Outlook Calendar items which makes it possible to set visual as well as audible reminders to Calendar items. In addition, this month’s release also introduces a new feature of adding as well as retrieving attachments from iCal files.

With this month's release, the Aspose.Email installer now includes our examples dashboard as well which fetches the programmer's guide examples from Github for readily usage. You can launch the examples dashboard once the installation completes.

This month’s release also fixes a number of bugs related to various functionality of API including encoding issues, messages conversion to TIFF as well as XPS, and Exchange clients, which further improves the overall functionality of the API.
