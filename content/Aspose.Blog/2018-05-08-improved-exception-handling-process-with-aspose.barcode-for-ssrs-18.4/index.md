We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.BarCode for Reporting Services 18.4. The major development in this release is the enhanced exception handling process.

## Enhancement

It was observed that **ThrowExceptionWhenCodeTextIncorrect** property was not working properly and API was generating barcode successfully with incorrect text input. The exception handling process has been enhanced in such way that **ThrowExceptionWhenCodeTextIncorrect** property is set and incorrect text is supplied for encode types SwissPostParcel, SingaporePost and Databars, it will throw **codetext is invalid** exception.
