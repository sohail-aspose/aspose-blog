[![Aspose.Cells for SSRS icon][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Cells-for-SSRS-e1377591440623.png)We are happy to announce the release of Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services 2.0.0. In this release, we have optimized the Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services Report Designer. You can now load Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services add-ins for Excel x64. You can configure Report Servers to store or cache the report server data. Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services Report Designer saves current accessed report server URL. When you open the report server manager dialog in the Aspose.Cells Report Designer again, the dialog form automatically loads the saved report server information.  You can also import a report definition file for SSRS2008 or SSRS2008R2.

Aspose.Cells also supports SSRS 2008R2 Shared DataSets now. When Aspose.Cells Report Designer opens a report definition file which includes shared datasets, it can automatically get dataset information which includes fields form.

We have enhanced the performance regarding render files and fixed some issues with exporting reports. We have figured out some issues regarding cell formatting. This release fixes a number of internal and external bugs and includes several new enhancements too. For example, the header and footer issues, certain issues with conditional formatting, issues with merging data, page breaks and hyperlinks are addressed in this release. We made lots of improvements regarding Microsoft Excel 2007/2010 file formats and conversions.
