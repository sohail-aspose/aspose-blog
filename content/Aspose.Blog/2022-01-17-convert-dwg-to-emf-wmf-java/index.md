## Convert DWG to EMF Image Programmatically in Java {#section2}

You can convert a DWG file to an EMF image by following the steps below:

1.  Load the input DWG file using the [Image][9] class constructor.
2.  Instantiate an object of [CadRasterizationOptions][10] class.
3.  Set different properties for output image.
4.  Save the output EMF image.

The following code sample explains how to convert a DWG file to an EMF image programmatically in Java:



## Convert DWG to WMF Image Programmatically in Java {#section3}

You can convert a DWG file to a WMF image with the steps below:

1.  Firstly, load the input DWG file with the [Image][11] class.
2.  Initialize an instance of [CadRasterizationOptions][12] class.
3.  Initialize [WmfOptions][13] class object.
4.  Save the output WMF image.

The following code sample elaborates how to convert a DWG file to a WMF image programmatically in Java:
