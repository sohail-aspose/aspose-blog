We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 17.4.

This release has been developed based on Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.4, which has been released with support of some new features including improved charts, embedded objects and printing support. The improved rendering support in Aspose.Slides for .NET will achieve better rendering of SQL Server reports when exporting to PowerPoint or other formats using Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 17.4 Release Notes][1] for further reference.
