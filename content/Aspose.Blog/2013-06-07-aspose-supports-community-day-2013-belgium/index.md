[![User group][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/11/user-group.png)[Community Day 2013][2] is a Belgian conference that lets the community do the talking. Each session is run by a Microsoft user group, delivering content they know is useful and interesting. The main goal of the 2013 edition is to deliver high-quality sessions, and the [agenda][3] suggests that they're succeeded.

[Aspose develops components and tools][4] that make the lives of developers and administrators easier. We're developers ourselves and understand the desire to focus on the interesting stuff like learning new technologies and implementing new features. We also know that businesses are not universities, and commercial pressures mean development has to be efficient.

This is why we create the products we do: we encapsulate our our file format expertise so developers can save time when working with files and help their companies implement document management quickly and efficiently.

It is also why we support user groups and conferences: learning isn't always something you can do on the job. But learning, keeping up your skills, isn't just what makes software engineering so interesting, it's vital to a long and satisfying career. This is where the community is so important: meeting peers lets you learn from them and share your own experience.

Community Day 2013 encapsulates that ethos. The Belgian Microsoft community is getting together to share knowledge. We're delighted to sponsor the event and wish everyone who speaks and attends a great day.

Community Day 2013 takes place on June 20, 2013, in Utopolis Mechelen, Mechelen, Belgium.
