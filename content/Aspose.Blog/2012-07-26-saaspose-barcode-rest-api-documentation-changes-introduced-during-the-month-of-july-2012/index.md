[Saaspose.Barcode][1] is a platform independent **REST API** that allows you to [generate][2] and [recognize][3] barcodes.You can generate barcode images in a variety of image formats like JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF and many others.During the month of July 2012, we have updated our [documentation][4] with a set of features to help you **generate barcode images** and **recognize barcode** from different types of images. You can create barcodes and get image as stream or save image to local disk. Using [Saaspose.Barcode][5], you can also read barcode from external image, local image or you may choose to specify barcode symbology.   Following is a list of examples that we have provided for programming languages like .NET and Java during the month of July 2012. **.NET Examples**
