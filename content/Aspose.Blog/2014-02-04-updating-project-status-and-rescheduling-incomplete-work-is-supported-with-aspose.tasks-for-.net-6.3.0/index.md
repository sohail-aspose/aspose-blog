[![][1]](https://products.aspose.com/tasks/net)We are pleased to share the release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET 6.3.0 that includes new feature and a number of improvements.

Microsoft Project provides the option to update project work as completed through a specified date for the entire project or specified tasks only. The uncompleted project work can then be rescheduled to start after a specified date. This monthâ€™s release of Aspose.Tasks provides the same capability to update project work and reschedule uncompleted work through a specified date.

Gantt chart rendering to various output formats was introduced in an earlier release. This feature was further improved in the follow-up versions e.g. capability of rolling up Gantt chart bars during rendering was provided. This month's release brings further improvements to Gantt chart rendering including sorting tasks by any column, customizing text display with task bars and aligning contents of cells.

We have also improved the API functionality in terms of fixes for a number of bugs reported by our customers such as baseline information that couldn't be read, issues with the actual duration and work of a task and some others. For further information on what is new and fixed, please visit Aspose.Tasks' [product download page][2].
