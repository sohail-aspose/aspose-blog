Aspose offers a wide variety of APIs to work with file formats. Considering your requirements and expectations, another exciting product, **[Aspose.SVG for .NET][1]** is in the making. We have researched many dimensions and strengths of SVG file format and then designed the API to satisfy almost all of your needs. The Document Object Model of Aspose.SVG for .NET API is completely in line with SVG specifications. It will be a feature-rich API that will allow loading, saving as well as converting SVG files as per your requirements. Reading or traversing the elements of the SVG file will also be possible. For now, it will support .NET Framework and soon we will include other platforms like Java, C++ and many more.

## Features included in Aspose.SVG for .NET

You will be able to edit and manipulate SVG files where some of the features are mentioned below:

*   Load an existing SVG image, edit or manipulate it and save the updated version
*   Converting SVG image to several formats including PDF, JPG, XPS, and others
*   Content navigation with CSS selectors and XPath Query

We are planning to publish the first version of the API at the most joyous time of the year, this Christmas season. Internal testing and quality assurance processes are underway and we will be rolling out Aspose.SVG for .NET API as soon as we get it ready for you to work with. Like other products offered by Aspose, this API will have detailed and well-managed documentation space and example project so that you can easily achieve your requirements.
