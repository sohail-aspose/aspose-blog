We feel proud to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for .NET 5.0.0. Now, we have made it possible to import OpenOffice presentations in ODP format and save them as PPTX. We have also improved the chart rendering support and isolated the dependency of Aspose.Slides for .NET on Aspose.Cells for .NET. However, if one needs to modify or add data in charts, he still needs to use Aspose.Cells for .NET. Many issues related to presentation access have also been resolved. The slide cloning for both PPT and PPTX has also been improved. We have also enhanced the rendering support for PDF and thumbnails generation.
