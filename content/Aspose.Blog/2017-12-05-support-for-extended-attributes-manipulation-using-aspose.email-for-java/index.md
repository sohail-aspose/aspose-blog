## Work with Extended Attributes of Message using EWS in Java

This version of Aspose.Email for Java provides the capability to work with [Extended Attributes of messages][3] using the API’s EWS client. Extended attributes can be added to message in the same way as adding Named properties to messages. The API now has FetchMapiMessage method that allows retrieving a message from the Exchange Server along with such properties associated with it. This is as shown in the following sample code.
