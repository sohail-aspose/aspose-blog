We are pleased to announce that the first version 18.5 of Aspose.3D for Java API has been released. Aspose.3D for Java API has incorporated import and export features, and developers would be able to convert their 3D models to any supported 3D formats. All readable and writable supported file formats are listed in these help topics: [Read 3D document][1] and [Save 3D document][2].

## Create an Animated Scene in Java

Aspose.3D for Java API supports rendering the animated scene, and the help topic narrates prerequisites to move an object. Developers can also set up the Camera with a target to constrain.

Please refer to this help topic: [Add Animation Property and Setup Target Camera in 3D document][3]

## Create Primitive 3D Shapes and Convert Meshes to Binary Format

Aspose.3D for Java API includes support of creating 3D scene from scratch, defining Metadata of the 3D scene, creating primitive 3D Shapes and visiting sub nodes to convert meshes to custom binary format. Please refer to following help topics:

*   [Add Asset Information to 3D Document][4]
*   [Create Scene with Primitive 3D Shapes][5]
*   [Save 3D Meshes in Custom Binary Format][6]

## Manipulate Objects in 3D Scene

With Aspose.3D for Java API, developers can generate and store tangent and binormal data for all meshes. The tangent and bitangent are orthogonal vectors with the Normal and instruct about the rate of change of the texture coordinates over the mesh surface. Developers can also triangulate mesh, split mesh, convert primitive shapes to meshes, encode 3D mesh in the Google Draco file, convert all Polygons to triangles and generate normal data for all meshes of the 3D scene. Please refer to these help topics:

*   [Build Tangent and Binormal data for all Meshes in 3D Model][7]
*   [Convert Mesh to Triangle Mesh and Primitive Shape to Mesh][8]
*   [Encoding 3D Mesh in the Google Draco File][9]
*   [Generate Normal Data for All Meshes of 3D Model][10]
*   [Split Mesh][11]
*   [Convert all Polygons to triangles in 3D Model][12]

## Work with Geometric Data of 3D Scene

Aspose.3D for Java API supports rotating objects in a 3D scene, add node hierarchy, share geometry data of mesh between multiple nodes, concatenate Quaternions apply to 3D objects, define Mesh from scratch, set up normals or UV on objects and also add Material. All code examples are available in these help topics: 

*   [Adding Transformation to the Node][13]
*   [Add Node hierarchy and Share Geometric data of Mesh among Multiple Nodes of 3D Scene][14]
*   [Concatenate Quaternions and apply on 3D entities][15]
*   [Create 3D Mesh and Scene][16]
*   [Set up normals or UV on Cube and Add Material to 3D Entities][17]
