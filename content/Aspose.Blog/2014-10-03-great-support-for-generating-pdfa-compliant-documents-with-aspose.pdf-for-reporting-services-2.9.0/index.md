We are pleased to announce the maintenance release of [Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services 2.9.0][1] which includes fixes for issues reported in earlier versions. Generation of PDF/A compliant documents is one of the features not provided by Microsoft Report Server's native PDF generation feature which Aspose.Pdf supplies. Please note that this component is quite flexible and depending upon your requirements, you may configure it to accomplish features like setting page orientation of the output PDF file (landscape or portrait), adding HTML content (which render accordingly in the output PDF instead of HTML tags), setting security privileges and encrypting PDF files, specifying page dimensions for the output document, adding XMP metadata, specifying PDF compression and much more. A  complete set of features which make this component stand out can be viewed on the Configure Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services page.

In this release, the specific area of improvement has been the conversion of .RDL files to PDF/A compliant PDF documents. In fact some of the customers have recently reported that their reports were not being rendered in PDF/A format, but this new version is more reliable and better than earlier releases. So we recommend you to try migrating to hte latest release which is more reliable and generates PDF files with great fidelity.

Please get the download and start exploring the exciting new release of [Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services 2.9.0][2].
