## 2012 in Review - new products, new ventures

Welcome to 2013! 2012 was Aspose's 10th year in business. We celebrated by reconnecting with some of our first customers to find out what they had been up to and what they're planning next. They see a future of increased demand for instant data and are working more and more with online content. It's been an interesting decade for us, and for our users too.

Connecting with old customers was great, but we had to look forward too. 2012 saw the release of new products and heard us announce a number of ventures. We continued autoporting and improving our products and won several awards. [Read more about what we achieved][1]. We have great plans for 2013.

Holiday Offer: 25% off Aspose.Total

We're offering 25% off Aspose.Total until the end of January 2013. Simply quote **XMAS2012NL** [when placing your order][2]. (The offer is only available to new license purchases of Aspose.Total and cannot be used in conjunction with another offer.

Thank you for reading,  
John Owens, Aspose Scotland Team Leader
