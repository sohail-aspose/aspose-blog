**May 10, 2005 - Sydney, Australia** \- In January, Aspose announced the release of Aspose.Words for Java, the first of their products for Java. A few months later we are delighted to announce yet another Java product: Aspose.Metafiles for Java. Aspose.Metafiles for Java addresses the issue of working with metafiles – EMF and WMF files – in a Java environment. Metafiles are designed to be portable and can contain both bitmap and vector image data. With Aspose.Metafiles for Java, Java developers can open metafiles, read their information and convert them to other image formats from within their Java applications. No other applications are necessary for this to work: Aspose.Metafiles does all the work. Aspose.Metafiles works with Aspose.Slides for Java and enables Aspose.Slides for Java to read presentations that contain metafiles, and add metafile images to existing presentations. Since the company started in 2002, Aspose's focus has been on file management products for .NET. The move to also supporting Java is logical: Java developers face similar challenges to .NET developers and Java is a standard programming language used widely for business applications. Managing and converting files from within Java applications or .NET applications demands either automation or time-consuming development and testing. Using Aspose's products, developers can focus on their own applications and avoid being distracted by the need for file management solutions.
