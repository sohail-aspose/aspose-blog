We are pleased to announce our next version of [Aspose.Words for Java.Android 17.3][1]. Aspose.Words for Java.Android 17.3 sees the codebase better tweaked and the core functionality closer to Aspose.Words for .NET/Java 17.3, which is the product that Aspose.Words for Java.Android is ported from. 

This month’s release contains many useful new features, enhancements and bug fixes. Please see the [release notes][2] for more detail. If you are planning to upgrade from old version of Aspose.Words to the current version, we would strongly suggest you to check the [Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes][3] section to know what APIs are changed so far.

Here is a look at just a few of the biggest features and API changes in this month’s release.

*   Words for Android is delivered as a single JAR file.
*   The size of the file is reduced.
*   Easy Gradle integration.
*   Full support of digital signatures.
*   Performance improvements.
*   Support of Metered License.

## Introduced Metered Licensing

Starting from 17.2.0 version, Aspose.Words for Android provides the functionality to use metered licensing mechanism. Aspose.Words for Android now allows developers to apply metered key. It is a new licensing mechanism. The new licensing mechanism will be used along with existing licensing method. Those customers who want to be billed based on the usage of the API features can use the metered licensing. The following code example shows how to set metered public and private keys.

## How to Use Aspose.Words for Android from 17.2.0 Onward

Previous Versions 1.11 and 1.12 were manually divided into two parts: jar and apk in order to limit the number of methods in DEX file. In these versions, we provided our own apk loader to initiate the correct loading of the additional classes.dex file.

Now starting from this release Aspose.Words for Android is delivered as a single JAR file, we have started to reduce the size of Aspose.Words for Android library. Our major concern now is to reduce the number of methods without loss of functionality. We are constantly working on improving the quality and usability of Aspose.Words for Android. Please review the following article for more detail.
