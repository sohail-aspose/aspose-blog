[![][1]](https://products.aspose.com/tasks/net)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET 7.0.0.  This month’s release includes enhancements to the rendering functionality of the Aspose.Tasks API to make its output closer to Microsoft Project's output. It also includes a number of bug fixes for issues that were reported with the previous version of the API. For complete details of all the enhancements and bug fixes in this month’s release, please visit our [product download page][2].

## Retaining Output View during Project Rendering

A project document has a number of views such as Gantt chart, task usage, resource usage, resource sheet, task sheet, etc. Each view has its own settings that the used define and Microsoft Project retains these views when rendering data to various output formats such as PDF, PNG, and others. We are pleased to share that this month’s release exhibits the same behavior while rendering project data to different formats. This can be achieved by simply rendering the output to the desired output format without writing any extra code. Supported views in this case include:

*   Gantt chart
*   Task usage
*   Resource usage
*   Resource sheet
*   Task sheet

Find out more.

## Retaining Project Data Columns when Rendering

This month’s release also provides the capability to retain all the columns as in the source MPP file while rendering to various output formats. This keeps all the columns in the output, including custom field columns. Find out more.

## Rendering Project Data as a Single Image

Aspose.Tasks for .NET now allows rendering of the whole project to a single image without any page borders. This makes it possible to render large projects to a single image using a large page size such as A0.

## Bug Fixes & Other Improvements

This month’s release also fixes a number of bugs that were reported with the previous version of Aspose.Tasks for .NET. These include:

*   Rendering resource names for recurring tasks to avoid jumbling them up.
*   Exceptions while loading and saving certain MPP files.
*   Minor issues related to the Gantt chart view.
*   Disabling automatic task sorting during MPP to PDF conversion.
*   Issues with saving project data to separate files using memory stream.
