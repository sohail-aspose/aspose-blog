Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java 2.4.1.0 is released now. In this latest version of Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java replace text, extract text and encryption features are improved. With this new release, a PDF file retains the meta data successfully even when manipulated with other methods before encryption. It also allows you to replace text multiple times in a file during single operation.
