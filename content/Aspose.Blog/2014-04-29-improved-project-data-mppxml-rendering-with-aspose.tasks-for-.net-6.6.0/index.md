[![][1]](https://products.aspose.com/tasks/net)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET 6.6.0 which includes a number of new features and fixes. The release also includes a number of bug fixes that further brings improvements to the API functionality.

For more information on what is new and fixed, you may visit the [product download page][2].

## Rendering Project Data to 24 bpp RGB Format

PixelFormat specifies the format of the color data for each pixel in an image, that is, it defines the number of bits of memory associated with one pixel of data. The Aspose.Tasks API can already export project data to various image formats, but the facility to configure the output pixel format was not available. We are glad to share that this month’s release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides the facility to configure the output image format to 24 bpp RGB. Controlling the dpi resolution is another useful feature for rendering project data to TIFF files. Aspose.Tasks has provided a feature that configures the horizontal and vertical resolution in dpi in this release thus providing comprehensive control over rendering.

## Exporting Specific Gantt Chart view

Last month’s release included reading all or specific Gantt chart view data capability for Microsoft Project 2003 and 2007 file formats. In the current release, the same feature has been provided for 2010 and 2013 file formats as well.
