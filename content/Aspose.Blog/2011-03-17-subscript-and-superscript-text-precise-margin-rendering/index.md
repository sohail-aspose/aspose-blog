Leaping ahead in the quest for producing better rendering products, Aspose is proud to release another version of Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services which provides the capability to render SubScript and SuperScript text in resultant PDF documents. You can either use "custom report property" or "Sub and Sup HTML tags" to render the text accordingly. The margin rendering has become even more precise and the resultant PDF's are more identical to the source report documents.
