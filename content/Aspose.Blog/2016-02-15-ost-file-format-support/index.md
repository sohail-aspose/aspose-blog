[Aspose.Email for Java 6.2.0][1] has been released. Ported from its equivalent .NET version, this month’s release includes the same new features, enhancements and bug fixes. In addition, a number of existing API functionality has been marked as obsolete/deprecated. Our documentation section, Public API Changes, can be visited for details about such changes.

## **Support for OST 2013 & 2016 File Formats**

The API now supports OST 2013 and 2016 Outlook file formats. The API’s PersonalStorage class can be used to load these files and process in the same way as any other PST/OST file. However, it should be noted that at present, the API only supports reading these file formats, and creating these file formats is not supported at present.

## **Listing Appointments from Exchange Server with Paging Support**

This month’s release also provides support for listing appointments from Microsoft Exchange server with Paging Support. It facilitates to list large number of appointments from server as per the number of items specified per page.

## **Paging Support for Listing Messages using IMAP**

Aspose.Email for Java now supports listing messages from mail server with paging support using the API’s IMAP client. Messages can now be retrieved from mailbox with specified number of items per page.

## **Insertion/Replacement of MSG attachments in an Email**

This month’s release also introduces a new feature of inserting an attachment at a specific index in attachments. It also provides the capability to replace contents of a message attachment. This facilitates the inclusion of an attachment in a message’s body at specific index.

## **Loading VCard contacts with Encoding**

Aspose.Email API had already the support of working with VCard contacts. This month’s release further enhances this functionality by providing the capability of specifying encoding while loading such contacts.

## **Fetching Contact by Id**

The Exchange Web Service (EWS) client of the API provides the capability to retrieve contacts information from Exchange server. This month’s release now further enhances this feature by providing the capability to fetch a contact by its id. This provides quick retrieval of a contact from Exchange server if its meta-data is available.

## Other Improvements

As Aspose.Email for Java is ported from its equivalent .NET version, it includes the same bug fixes that were part of the .NET version. Details about these can be found in the [API’s download section][2].
