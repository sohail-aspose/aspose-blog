Hi All,

We have released Aspose.Cells for Java 2.0.1 for the users.

Since the Open Document Format (ODF) for Office Applications is expected to become an industry standard for sharing documents, we have introduced support for importing / exporting spreadsheets in ODS (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) format in this version.

We have also incorporated some new features. For example, setting shared formula is supported and strong encryption type is available now. You may manipulate some advanced controls (e.g. Check box, Button, Radio button, Combo box, List box, Group box, Scroll bar, Label etc.). The component supports to get image data of Pictures and Ole Objects; it also supports to create pivot charts. There are some other features and enhancements too.
