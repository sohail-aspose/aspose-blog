[![][1]](http://www.aspose.com/java/project-management-component.aspx)Aspose.Tasks for Java 7.4.0 has been released. This monthâ€™s release is sort of maintenance release that fixes minor issues in the API. Specifically, it fixes issues related to rendering project data to PNG, JPG, and BMP that were encountered during internal testing of the functionality. In addition, the API also includes minor code optimizations as per requirements. Since, we have already revamped the Aspose.Tasks for .NET API, the revamped Aspose.Tasks for Java version will also be available soon. Please feel free to share your inquiries with us over the [Aspose.Tasks forum][2].
