We like to share the product release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 4.11.0. In this release we have introduced new features to the product to further strengthen its capabilities.

We have introduced support for exporting reports to XPS format using Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services in this release. Now, you can export the reports to XPS format.

We have also improved the product installation procedure by providing support for enhanced logging. The extended logging support is available for cases with installation errors. If an error happens, the error message will contain more details about an error reason, not just "Object null reference exception". This allows us to help you more quicklyÂ  to address installation issues on your end.
