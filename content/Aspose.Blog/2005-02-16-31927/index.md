We are glad to announce that recently Aspose was able to help sponsor a Windows .NET Development meeting in Italy. The event was coordinated by an Italian .NET resource site, dotnetCircle.it . Daniele Bochicchio, one of the main coordinators, was kind enough to share an online photo gallery that contains many images taken at the event. Over 270 participants gathered to learn and share about the .NET technologies. Aspose is excited to be able to be a part of such events and help the .NET community to grow.

If you or your group has such an event and would like to visit with us about sponsorship opportunities, please feel free to email [marketing@aspose.com][1] with details.
