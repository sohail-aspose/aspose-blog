Dear Customers,

We've released the Aspose.Network 3.0.1 hotfix.

In this hotfix, we fixed a bug in parsing Outlook Message file (\*.msg), which contains the unicode encoding characters in the mail header.

It is a Must Be update for Aspose.Network 3.0

Bug Detail:

Aspose.Network 3.0.0.0818 will crash in  parsing the outlook message file with unicode mail header content, throwing out an exception as following:

System.ArgumentException was unhandled  
  Message="Media type is not valid.  
Parameter name: mediaType"  
  ParamName="mediaType"  
  Source="Aspose.Network"
