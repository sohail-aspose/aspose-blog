This monthâ€™s release includes support for setting Print job while printing Excel files. We have enhanced the RTL (Right to Left) language support when rendering to PDF, TIFF, HTML, etc. A number of bug fixes are also included in this release. This release is also a maintenance release where several important issues have been fixed. Many issues around reading and writing spreadsheets or other files (XLS, XLSX, HTML, etc.), rendering shapes, copying conditional formatting, apply formatting, rendering PivotTables and exporting to PDF and HTML have been resolved. Issues pertaining to charts and the formula calculation engine have also been corrected in this release.
