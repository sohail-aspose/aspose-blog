We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.BarCode for Reporting Services 18.6.  
  
This is a maintenance release whereby we have resolved some incurring issues in API. It was reported that adding BarCode dependency from NuGet was throwing exception. Upon investigation, it was found that the issue is due to dependency on **SkiaSharp** in .NET Framework. This issue has been fixed.

To view the complete list of fixes, please visit the [release notes][1] page. You can download the latest version by visiting the [Aspose.BarCode for Reporting Services 18.6][2] page in downloads section.
