![Aspose.Tasks logo][1]

We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET 5.1.0. This month's release includes a number of enhancements as well as bug fixes.

We already supported rendering complete project data. With this release Aspose.Tasks supports rendering individual views of a project to various output formats. We support rendering the [resource usage view][2], resource sheet view and [task usage view][3]. In addition, this version also includes enhancement for getting the number of pages for different views with various timescale settings.

This release also includes bug fixes related to certain features of MPP files such as resource baseline, WBS, extended attributes and updating, as can be seen from the [Product Release page][4].
