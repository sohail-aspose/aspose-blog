[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/aspose-Barcode-for-net_100.png)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.BarCode for .NET 6.5.0. The barcodes PDF417, MacroPDF417, QR and PatchCode can hold a lot of information. The Aspose.BarCode API is handy because it can encode and decode these codes too. Developers can add this feature to their .NET applications. The plus point of this release is that it reworks PDF417 code recognition. Users can now get more accurate recognition along with speedy scan.

## Decoding Improvements

This new release delivers improved recognition and quick reading capabilities for PDF417, MacroPDF417, QR and PatchCode symbologies. This release comprises a number of key fixes that help us improve decoding:

*   Fixed: inaccurate recognition of PDF417 from TIFF, PNG, PDF and JPG formats.
*   Fixed: inaccurate and recognition failure cases of MacroPDF417 from BMP and PNG formats.
*   Fixed: inaccurate and recognition failure cases ofÂ PatchCode from JPG format.
*   Fixed: taking too long to recognize QR code.
