**Sydney, Australia - 03 May 2013** - Aspose merged [Aspose.PDF for Java][1] and Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java into one product with the release of Aspose.Pdf for Java 4.0.0. The merge was achieved by autoporting Aspose.Pdf for .NET to Java.

## Aspose.PDF for Java and Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java

[Aspose.PDF for Java][2] is a PDF document creation component that software developers use to create PDF files from images, other document formats or XML. Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java, meanwhile, is a PDF document manipulation component used to manage and manipulate existing PDF files as well as manage form fields embedded within PDF files.

Since the two products were launched, their use has converged to the point where it makes sense to merge them into one powerful component that allows developers to create and manipulate PDF files. We have already merged Aspose.Pdf for .NET and Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET into one product and the next step was to do the same for the Java products.

## Autoporting from Aspose.PDF for .NET

To improve our products and streamline the product development process, Aspose's development team has been working to autoport .NET products to Java. Autoporting is the process of porting .NET products to Java using a tool that automates the process. The process benefits both our users, who get more powerful, feature-rich component, and Aspose, who can single-source the code for both products.

There were two possible approaches to merging Aspose.Pdf for Java and Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java: manually merging the two code bases or autoporting from Aspose.Pdf for .NET. Autoporting was the smarter approach. Autoporting achieves two objectives: it creates a single-source code base for Aspose.Pdf for . NET and Aspose.Pdf for Java, and it merges Aspse.Pdf.Kit for Java's features into Aspose.Pdf for Java.

## Merged API Released

The first version of the merged API was released in April 2013. Aspose.Pdf.Kit for Java will remain a product for some months but will eventually be discontinued when users have converted to using the new product.
