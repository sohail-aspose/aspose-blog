We are pleased to announce the September release of [Aspose.3D][1] API. This version includes support for CancellationToken which enables better control over your applications. In specific scenarios, the program keeps on executing for a long time. Now you can preempt the process once specified amount of time is consumed. Moreover, we have also optimized memory consumption while opening huge [FBX][2] files and ImportException does not occur while working with huge files, as well as the occurrence of ExportException has been taken care of. AssetInfo class has been enhanced to load all properties from FBX's global settings. You can use following links to download Aspose.3D for .NET and Java APIs.
