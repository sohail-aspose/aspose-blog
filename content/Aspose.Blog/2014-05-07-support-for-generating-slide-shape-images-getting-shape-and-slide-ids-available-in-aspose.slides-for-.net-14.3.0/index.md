[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png) We like to share the release announcement of Aspose.Slides for .NET 14.3.0. This is one of our major product releases where we have included some new features and resolved several issues.

## New Features

We have introduced support for generating individual slide thumbnails in this release. The feature has been requested by many of our customers and now you can generate the shape thumbnail with both actual and user defined dimensions. Please visit the documentation article Creating Shape Thumbnails for further details. We have also improved the quality of SmartArt rendering support along with support for inserting hyperlinks for SmartArt shapes in this release. We have also resumed the support for getting **SlideID** and **ShapeID** in this release as well.

## Resolved Issues

In this release, we have resolved issues pertaining to accessing and saving presentations that resulted in different exceptions in earlier product versions. We have also rectified issues related to corrupted presentations generated using Aspose.Slides. We have also resolved issues related to slide cloning and improper chart rendering.

There have been rendering issues while working tables in PPT presentation tables. The table rendering issues have been resolved to a great extent in this new release. Some of text and bullets rendering issues in generated slide thumbnails and exported PDF files have also been rectified.

We have made some enhancements to the new API. Please visit the documentation article Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for .NET 14.3.0 for further reference.
