We have released the Aspose.Cells for Java v2.5.0 for the users.

In this version, we have supported to read/write MS Excel 2007 XLSB format. We include new ShapeTextFrame class to the API set to auto-fit the contents of shapes. Now the dotted lines would be rendered fine in Chart-to-Image feature. Moreover, we have enhanced/optimized the following features:

*   Chart-to-Image
*   Direct Excel-to-PDF
*   Sheet-to-Image
*   Sheet-to-Print

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
