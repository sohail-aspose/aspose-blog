Hi all,

We are splitting all product pages including documentation of the .NET and Java versions of Aspose.Words to eliminate any confusion for customers about which features are avilable where. Each page including Case Studies, Buzz, Testimonials is going to have its own version for .NET and Java.

I have just realized we do not have even one testimonial for Aspose.Words for Java (all testimonials have been for .NET so far).

Be the first to post a testimonial for Aspose.Words for Java here in the forums and I will later move it onto a more prominent position on the product page.

Thanks!
