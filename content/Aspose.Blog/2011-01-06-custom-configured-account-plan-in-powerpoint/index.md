## Problem

In the majority of cases, Account planning in sales involves a PowerPoint presentation. Stratascope was able to provide a substantial amount of content for an account plan but we were facing difficulties in delivering that content in an easy to use form. Users had to cut and paste individual objects onto their own slides or submit the PDF version of our content as a supplement to their presentation. The bottom line was the user had a choice of “too much work” or “not very seamless”.

## Solution

We chose [Aspose.Slides for .NET][1] as a mechanism to deliver our dynamic account plan content, which resulted in an easy to use approach, owing to the fact that our users were already familiar with PDF output and we got the ability to produce a custom slide deck ranging from 15 to 150 slides. While taking the high end 150 slides multiplied by the 2.5 million accounts that we support, [Aspose.Slides for .NET][2] enabled us to dynamically configure and deliver over 375 million high-quality custom slides to our users.

As the users were allowed to include their own custom content, the real slide count have been infinite. We also included the ability for users to control the flow of the presentation and the repositioning of the slides and after that, we generated the table of contents slide. In order to provide custom look and feel, the users had the ability to choose their own color template and include their company logos.

## Experience

### **Finding a solution**

In order to solve our problems, we have been searching for tools over the web for years and before we started our [trial][3] with [Aspose.Slides for .NET][4], we compared multiple products. Within 60 days, we completed our project and were ready for deployment with very little assistance required from technical [support][5].

### **Implementation**

The biggest challenge was dealing with the dynamic nature and variable length of our content. We were able to design a template from which users can copy the required slides and fill them with their content. As a result, users were able to get a completely custom layout and flow. We used the [Aspose support forums][6] but had no need to call into the Aspose support organization.

### **Outcome**

We have been very happy with the output produced. Our customers have also been very much excited about the PDF format. We are sure that going forward, our efforts will be received even more enthusiastically.

## Next Steps

The solution that we have produced is a complete solution. Also, in order to meet our client's requests, our next steps involve some minor tweaking of the offering and the possibility of offering more than 8 color templates for users.

## Summary

Our overall experience of working with Aspose and [Aspose’s products][7] has been excellent. The product worked as advertised, the [documentation][8] was easy to follow, and the [support forums][9] were all the help we needed. The final solution that we deployed has exceeded our initial expectations by a great deal. We would strongly recommend [Aspose][10].
