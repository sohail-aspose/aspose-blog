We are happy to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for .NET 6.0.0. This release introduces many new features including support for password protecting presentation. Now, you can set the custom colors schemes for the presentation and can also have option to add column for table in PPTX presentations. Many of the presentation rendering issues that our customers have reported around generating slide thumbnails and PDFs have been resolved. Other issues with slide cloning along and presentation access  have also been mitigated in this new release.
