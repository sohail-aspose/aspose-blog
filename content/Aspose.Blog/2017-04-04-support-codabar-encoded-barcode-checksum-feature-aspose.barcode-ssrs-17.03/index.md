We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.BarCode for Reporting Services 17.03. The major development in this release is the support of Codabar encoded barcode with checksum feature. Feature to select symbology type from dropdown list instead of typing manually has also been incorporated in this release.

## EncodeType Property With DropDown List

Currently, EncodeType property takes in only string as input. Users have to write the exact/correct symbology into the text field. Defining encoding type of the barcode funcitonality, represented by EncodeType, has been updated and replaced with a dropdown list. You can now select desired encode type from dropdown list instead of typing manually. ![](http://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/04/encodeTypeDropDown-300x205.png)
