We released Aspose.Metafiles for Java 1.4.0 today.  
  
That is maintenance release and contains several important fixes only.  
  
Since it's first release published 3 years ago Aspose.Metafiles became very stable and renders most of WMF/EMF metafiles with highest quality. Thank you to all customers who reported bugs, requested better support of metafiles specification and waited for fixes.
