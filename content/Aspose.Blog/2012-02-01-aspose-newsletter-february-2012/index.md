## Announcing the sweepstake winner

In December we ran a sweepstake on Facebook; in January we had a grand prize draw. The winner of the sweepstake prize, an iPad 2, was Michael Sevast. He was much surprised to find that he had won but also had kind words to say about Aspose:

"We have used the Apose.Total for .NET components, for several years now. These tools greatly simplify our ability to interact with and export to known Microsoft formats. The speed of these components saves us considerable time over custom in-house solutions."

We wish Michael joy with his prize and thank him and every one else who took part in the sweepstake.

Many thanks,  
John Owens, Aspose Scotland Team Leader

## Supporting User Groups - How Can We Help?

[](mailto:user.groups@aspose.com)We value our developer community and do what we can to support over 150,000 users. One way we support the community is by supporting user groups. User groups bring developers from different industries and with different experience together to learn from each other. We already sponsor several groups and provide swag and free licenses for competitions. If you lead a user group, or know of one that could benefit from our support, [please contact us][2]. We'd love to hear from you.

## Migration Tip – Extracting messages from a PST file with Aspose.Email for .NET

![Migration tip icon][8]One way of extracting messages from PST files in Microsoft Outlook is to use Microsoft Automation. For it to work, you need Outlook installed on the machine that the code runs on and you need to reference Microsoft Office Interop for Outlook. The other way is to use Aspose.Email for .NET. This migration tip compares the two techniques.
