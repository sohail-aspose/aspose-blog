Welcome to the August 2012 edition of the Saaspose Newsletter. This newsletter highlights the information about latest updates in APIs, exciting new features and the informative blogs. Keep your fingers crossed for the useful tip revealed in "Tip of the Month" section.![](https://blog.aspose.com/)

![](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/06/tip.png)**Tip of the Month: Integrate Amazon S3 Storage with Saaspose API** We have recently [integrated Amazon S3 Storage with Saaspose API][1]. Now, you can keep your files on Amazon S3 and use Saaspose API to process those files. It is quite simple and easy to configure Amazon S3 Storage with Saaspose. Once setup you can use Saaspose API to manage those files. We have also integrated Saaspose.Slides with Amazon S3 so you could upload your presentations on Amazon S3 Storage and process them using Saaspose.Slides. We have added examples to work with this external storage as well. Our team is working on integrating other Saaspose APIs with Amazon S3. We're also integrating our APIs with other cloud storage services. Please keep in touch for the latest information about external storage integration. ![](https://blog.aspose.com/)
