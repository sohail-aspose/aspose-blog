Aspose.Flash for .NET 2.1.0 has been released. This release supports **Flash v10**.

In the past, users were experiencing some trouble while manipulating or parsing Flash files that included those **Flash v10** tags which were not supported by Aspose.Flash. Now Aspose.Flash fully supports **Flash v10** and users can easily manipulate their SWF files that are generated using **Flash v8**, **v9**, **v10** or **Flash Lite** because support for **Flash v8**, **v9** and **Flash Lite** was included in the previous release of Aspose.Flash for .NET and support for **Flash v10** has been included in this release.

The Aspose.Flash for .NET 2.1.0 installer includes a separate build for .NET 3.5 and this release also includes some important fixes from previous versions.
