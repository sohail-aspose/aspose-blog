summary: 'Extensible Markup Language ([XML][1] is a file format that stores information using tags. It may be used for storing or transferring data. There might be situations where you need to transfer the data stored in an [MPP][2] file to some application that accepts XML as an input format.

Extensible Markup Language ([XML][3] is a file format that stores information using tags. It may be used for storing or transferring data. There might be situations where you need to transfer the data stored in an [MPP][4] file to some application that accepts XML as an input format. On the other hand, you might have project data in XML format that you may want to convert to MPP format. For such cases, you can inter-convert MPP and XML formats according to your needs. To that end, this article will teach you **how to convert MPP files to XML format and vice versa programmatically using C#**.

## C# API for Converting XML to MPP and Vice Versa {#CSharp-API-for-Converting-XML-to-MPP-and-Vice-Versa}

[Aspose.Tasks for .NET][8] is an API for working with Microsoft Project (MPP) files. It allows you to read and write MPP/XML files without requiring Microsoft Project to be installed. You can also convert XML files to MPP format and vice versa using the API. You can either install the API through [NuGet][9] or download it directly from the [Downloads][10] section.

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.Tasks
```

## Copy Data from an XML File to an MPP File using C# {#Copy-Data-from-an-XML-File-to-an-MPP-File-using-CSharp}

The following are the steps to copy data from an XML file to an MPP file using C#.

*   Load the XML file using the [Project][11] class.
*   Load the template MPP file using the [Project][12] class.
*   Copy data from the XML file to the MPP file using the [Project.CopyTo(Project another)][13] method.
*   Save the updated MPP project file using the [Project.Save(string filename,SaveFileFormat format)][14] method.

The following sample code shows how to copy data from an XML file to an MPP file using C#.
