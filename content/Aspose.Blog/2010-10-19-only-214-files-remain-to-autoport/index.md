It's been only five days since my previous report, but I cannot wait to say what a great progress we had.

Today's Aspose.Words for Java stats are:

*   Total source files 2413
*   Only 214 have autoporting problems = 8.8%
*   The rest 2199 of the C# source files are totally automatically convertable to Java.

In these five days we managed to review and make portable 311 files. Almost all document conversions modules are now portable. With all of the other supported formats, we are finally going to have WordML 2003, EPUB and MHTML in Aspose.Words for Java when this project is complete.
