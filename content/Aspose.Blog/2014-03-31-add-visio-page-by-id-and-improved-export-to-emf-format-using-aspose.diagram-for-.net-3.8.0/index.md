[![Aspose.Diagram for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/06/aspose-Diagram-for-net_100.png)Aspose.Diagram for .NET 3.8.0 has been released. We’re pleased to announce that from this new release, developers can add a new page by its ID. To do so, they can easily calculate a maximum page ID and increment it. The new Page (int ID) constructor allows you to pass the page ID. You'll find this feature in the following help topic: Insert a New Blank Page into a Visio Drawing

Another improvement is exporting Microsoft Visio drawings to EMF format. It has now been upgraded, especially during conversion. Previously, many cases showed error messages. Visio drawing export to HTML format has also been improved. The improved areas include a shape’s hyperlink redirection. In some cases, it was missing hyperlinks or its URL parameters. This release includes the most recent bug fixes and enhancements.
