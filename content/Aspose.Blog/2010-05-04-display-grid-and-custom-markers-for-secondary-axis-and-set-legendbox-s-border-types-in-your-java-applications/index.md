Aspose.Report for Java 1.7.0 has been released. This release includes support for grid, zero line and custom markers of the secondary axis. You can show or hide secondary axis grid and custom markers.

This release also supports different border types for the LegendBox and allows you to set appropriate margins to avoid LegendBox’s overlapping. You can set ChartArea’s margins if the LegendBox is outside the ChartArea and AxisArea’s margins if the LegendBox is inside the ChartArea to avoid LegendBox’s overlapping.
