We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for .NET 16.8.0. We have included some new features along with resolution some issues incurring in API.

## New Features

We have introduced the support for managing embedded fonts inside the presentation which include removing the embedded fonts from the presentation as well. For more about the supported features, please visit the documentation article, Managing Embedded Fonts. We have also included the support of generating responsive HTML from the presentation using Aspose.Slides, which will ensure proper viewing of generated HTML across different devices and browsers. Please visit the documentation article, [Converting Presentation to Responsive HTML][1].

## Resolved Issues

The presentation access and saving issues have been rectified for many presentation decks that resulted in exceptions including OverflowException, IndexOutOfRangeException, ArgumentException, UnSupportedFormatException, and PptReadException in previous releases. The presentation to SVG export has also been improved in this release and issues related to rendering as well as export exception issues have been rectified.

The issues related to cloned slides, background-color changing, and improper text on saving presentations have been addressed in this release. Moreover, issues related to charts and their elements rendering have been taken care of in this release. The text, shape, and improper color rendering issues for different shape elements inside exported HTML, PDF and SVG exports have been resolved as well in this release.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for .NET 16.8.0 Release Notes][2] for further reference.
