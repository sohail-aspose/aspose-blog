## Insert Hyperlink Dynamically using LINQ Reporting Engine

We have added new features in the LINQ Reporting engine i.e. insert the hyperlink to your report document dynamically using link tags. The syntax of a link tag is defined as follows.

**<<link \[uri\_or\_bookmark\_expression\] \[display\_text\_expression\]>>**

## Work with Document's Text Direction

In this release, we have added a new property DocumentDirection in TxtLoadOptions class to get or set the text direction (RTL / LTR) of the text document. You can use [DocumentDirection][2] enumeration to set the value of this property.

The following code example shows how to detect the text direction of the document after importing the TXT file.
