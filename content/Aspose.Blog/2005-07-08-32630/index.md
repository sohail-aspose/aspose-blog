Dear Customers,

We've finished working on the Aspose.Word Programmers Guide. It is available here:

http://www.aspose.com/Wiki/default.aspx/Aspose.Word/ProgrammersGuide.html

We really hope it answers most of your “howto” questions and you consider it helpful.

Of course, this is the first version of the guide and we'll be expanding and improving it accordingly to your reports and wishes. Any changes in the product API will surely affect the guide, too. Major additions and some changes will probably be done as soon as we release forthcoming Aspose.Word v3.0 because its API contains many useful and (we hope) desired improvements and new features.
