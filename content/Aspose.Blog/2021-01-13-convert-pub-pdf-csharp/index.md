[PUB][2] files are frequently used to publish data on a large scale. In this article, we will explore PUB to PDF conversion as well as Editing the metadata of a PUB document. You can create PDF documents with good fidelity. Likewise, you can work with different metadata properties of a publisher file. Let us explore the following sections related to PUB files:

*   [Convert or Manipulate PUB File – API Installation][3]
*   [Convert PUB to PDF Programmatically in C#][4]
*   [Edit Metadata of PUB File using C#][5]

## Convert or Manipulate PUB File – API Installation {#section1}

You can quickly install [Aspose.PUB for .NET][6] API by downloading it from the [New Releases][7] section, or via [NuGet][8] package manager in Visual Studio. The following command will configure the API in your project.
