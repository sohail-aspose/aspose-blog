Aspose PDF Importer Plugin allows developers to get/read contents of PDF documents without requiring any other software such as Adobe Acrobat or PDF reader. This plugin demonstrates the powerful import feature provided by [Aspose.PDF][2]. It adds a simple "Aspose PDF Importer" button on posts & pages. When users click the button, they get two options: importing from a local PDF file or from Aspose Cloud Storage.  The user selects a file, clicks "Insert PDF to Editor" and the text is inserted into the editor from the selected PDF file. This plugin uses WordPress Media Uploader for uploading local files. You can also select files from the WordPress Media Gallery.
