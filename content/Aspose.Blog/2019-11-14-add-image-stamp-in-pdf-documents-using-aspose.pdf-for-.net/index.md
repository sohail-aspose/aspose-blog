If you want to imprint PDF documents in order to deliver or showcase some important information, you will need to stamp it. Adding stamps in PDF documents allows you to label them with information, such as the document’s approval status or confidentiality. You can also add an image stamp in PDF documents to watermark or label it with the logo of your company. In simple words, stamping the PDF documents is a basic requirement for any business and Adobe Acrobat allows you to do this by offering editing tools. Imagine having a significant number of PDFs and stamping them manually using the tools. Well, the first thing which comes to mind is the time cost. Now think of doing the same job programmatically. Yes, it will not only reduce the time cost but you will also be able to customize the stamping process within no time. You can use Aspose.PDF for .NET in your .NET applications to automate the process as it provides the functionality to [add stamps in PDF documents][1]. You can add both text and image stamps in PDFs using the API. For example, let’s see how you can add an image stamp in PDF document and specify its location over the page.  

## Add Image Stamp as Background in Floating Box

[FloatingBox][2] allows you to display your content on any location over a PDF Page by specifying its position (top/left). Using the API, you can specify a background (image) of the floating box and place the box over the desired page to stamp it. Following code sample can be used to implement this functionality:
