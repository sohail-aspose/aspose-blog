The latest version of Aspose.Flash for .NET is now available for download. In Aspose.Flash for .NET 3.3.0, we have improved the text replacement mechanism inside an existing SWF file. We have also introduced a new overload of ConvertTrueTypeFontToSWFFont method of the FontManager class. In this overload, we have added a new parameter which allows you to specify the height of the font in twips and the resulting font is optimized according to this parameter. You can download the latest version from the [Aspose.Flash for .NET download section][1].
