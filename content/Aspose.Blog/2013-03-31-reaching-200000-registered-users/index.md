**Sydney, Australia - March 31, 2013** - In March 2013, Aspose counted 200,000 registered users. This milestone comes only three years after we reached 100,000 registered users. To celebrate, we're giving 20 new users prizes of licenses for our products. From a full suite of Aspose products, to a license for Aspose.Imaging, we're can't think of better gifts to give to our community than our products.

## Why Use Aspose?

Aspose's customers use our products to speed up development of .NET and Java systems, and to extend the file management capabilities of SharePoint, Reporting Services and JasperReports.

Our .NET and Java components make the lives of developers world-wide easier. Instead of getting lost in the minutiae of how to implement and manipulate Microsoft Office and other file formats, they use our components. Our APIs are well-designed and easy to use. They encapsulate our file format expertise to save other developers time and effort.

The same is true about our other components and extensions. Work with barcodes and Microsoft Word documents in SharePoint, or export SSRS reports to PDF, Microsoft Excel or Microsoft PowerPoint documents without losing fidelity. Easy to install, quick and reliable to use.

### Flexible Licensing and Support

We recognize that different companies have different needs but everyone needs stable, flexible and dependable products to work with. We have developed products, licenses, and support options to suit companies large and small. When you need several of our products, consider getting [Aspose.Total][2]: it brings together all our products across a platform and is the most cost effective way of buying them.

Everyone has access to our free support. Whether you're running an evaluation or have bought our products, post any issues in the [support forums][3] and we'll help you. If you want a chance to influence our roadmap, maybe [enhanced support is for you][4].

As well as support, we offer consulting services. If your company needs more help, our developers can work with your team to develop solutions.

## Celebrating Our Community

200,000 registered users is an impressive number. To celebrate the size of our online community, 20 of our recently registered users are receiving prizes from us. #200,000 gets licenses for all of our products, but the other 19 get good gifts too. We want to thank our users for signing up and show them that we appreciate their support. What better way than to give them a license?

We're in the process of contacting winners and will publicize them in the coming weeks.
