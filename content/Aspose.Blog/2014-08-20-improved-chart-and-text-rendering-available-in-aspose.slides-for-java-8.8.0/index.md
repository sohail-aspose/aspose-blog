[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-Java_100.png) We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for Java 8.8.0. This is a maintenance release in which we have resolved many presentation rendering issues. This release is part of ongoing transition phase during which we maintain both the legacy and new APIs for a period of one quarter.

## Fixes and Improvements

We have focused on rectifying chart rendering issues and have resolved several. The issues include missing charts, wrong chart labels, improper chart axis, missing chart legends and chart lines in exported thumbnails and PDF. We have also resolved the improper text rendering, improper font height, wrong word wrapping issues in generated PDF and slide thumbnails.
