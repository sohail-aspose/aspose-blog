[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for .NET 15.11.0. This is one of the maintenance releases in which we have added some new features as well.

## New Features

We have added the property FirstSlideNumber to the presentation class. Now the users can get or set the number of first slide by using this property. Please visit the documentation article Setting the Slide Number for further reference.

## Resolved Issues

We have improved the support for presentation access and their saving that resulted in generation of corrupted presentations with error warning or repair message when opened with PowerPoint. The presentation decks which were unable to be manipulated by earlier versions and resulted in exceptions including InvalidOperation, ClassCastException , FormatException, ArgumentException and OutOfMemoryException have been taken care of.

We have improved the image rendering support in this release and many issues which were incurring while working with tables have been rectified. Support for exporting the presentation to HTML has also been improved which earlier resulted in missing table borders, missing text, wrong indentation of text and missing slide number.

We have also enhanced the presentation rendering to PDF and images in this release for charts, text and SmartArt shapes. This release comes with the improved feature of working with slide animations. We have also addressed chart rendering issues including missing or improper chart legends, data labels and plot area while loading and saving the presentations.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Refer to the article Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for .NET 15.11.0 for further reference.
