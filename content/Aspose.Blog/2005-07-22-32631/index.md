Dear Customers,

**Aspose.Word v3.0** that was recently released includes the Beta version of **Aspose.Word.Viewer**. We made the Beta available because of many customers' requests to do so. Please note we do not provide any support on the viewer in the meantime just because it is still at development stage. Currently it has some limitations like these:

*   Rendering/printing capabilities are limited
*   Some documents can be rendered incorrectly
*   We do not guarantee its stability
*   Breaking changes are possible in the future

However, we proceed with working on the viewer extensively as we want to make its rendering capabilities maximally close to ones allowed by Microsoft Word. We will improve and make it stable so we hope to remove "Beta" from its name as soon as possible.
