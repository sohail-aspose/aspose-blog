We are pleased to announce our new product Aspose.OCR for Java. Aspose.OCR for Java is an optical character recognition component that allows developers to extract text from image files. You can extract text in hOCR format which not only gives you the extracted text but other text information (font and style etc.) as well.

Aspose.OCR for Java is aimed at the developers who need to add OCR functionality in their Java applications and provides a better performance. The API is extensible, easy to use and compact. It provides common functionality so that developers have to write less code when performing common tasks. Please refer to the [Aspose.OCR for Java documentation][1] for more details.
