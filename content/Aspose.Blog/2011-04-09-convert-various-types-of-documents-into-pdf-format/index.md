{{< figure align=center src="images/Screenshot-2020-04-28-at-3.48.18-PM.png" alt="SmartMatching UK company logo">}}


We are a specialist in software recruitment solutions based in the UK. Our customers are some of the leading TV Production Companies in the UK and Europe.

## Problem

We were looking for a solution that can enable us to [convert documents into PDF format][1] that can be uploaded into our recruitment system. We needed a PDF converter that could handle various types of document formats and produce a high quality of conversion. PDF would provide us with a standard document format for our system, allowing us to maintain consistency throughout our product. Our user base was excessing 30,000, so it was vital to select a product that matched all our criteria. The solution required was supposed to be lightweight in terms of resources needed, fast at document conversion, and could scale as our user base increases.

## Solution

We selected [Aspose.Words for .NET][2] for our solution because it met all our business and technical requirements. We integrated it into our recruitment product and our system was able to generate PDF of all the document formats uploaded by users. Users were then able to see standardized, professional-looking documents formatted consistently.
