[Aspose.Total for .NET][1] is a suite of Aspose products that allows you to work with different types of file formats in your .NET applications -- Windows Forms, Web Forms, Windows Services, etc. You can not only create, read or edit different file types using these components but also convert these files to various other formats.

In addition to that, these components also allow you to print various file types using your .NET code. In this blog post, I'll point you to the appropriate resources which can help you print PDF, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Barcode files.

You'll have to use Aspose.Pdf, Aspose.Words, Aspose.Cells, Aspose.Slides, and Aspose.Barcode for .NET to print PDF, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Barcode files respectively.

While working with PDF files using Aspose.Pdf for .NET, you can print these PDF files on physical or logical printers with specified printer and page settings.Â  You can also print the PDF file on XPS printer.

This component also allows you to print the Word documents using XPS print API. You can also print multiple pages on a single sheet using Aspose.Words for .NET.

This component allows the developers to print the Powerpoint presentation using .NET code. Similarly, Aspose.Cells for .NET is a quite flexible solution to manipulate Excel files in .NET code. This component provides the facility to print Excel Workbooks using .NET quite easily.
