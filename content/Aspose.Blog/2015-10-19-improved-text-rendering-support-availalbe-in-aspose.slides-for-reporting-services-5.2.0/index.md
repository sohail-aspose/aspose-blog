We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 5.2.0.

This release comes with improved text rendering support in exported presentations. The issues related to Strikethrough, Hyperlink, Font size and Font color of text, have been rectified in this release. Bulleted or Numbered list is an efficient way to emphasize information in a meaningful way that is why the issues with Bullets and numbers have been fixed in this release.

We have also resolved the issues like overlapping of Text Boxes, and Borders which did appear around different shapes when exporting the reports to presentations using earlier versions of Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services. All of these enhancements and bug fixes result in improved rendering of reports to presentations.

To see a complete list of fixes and to download Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services 5.2.0, please visit the [download page][1].
