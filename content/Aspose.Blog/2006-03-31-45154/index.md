Dear Customers,

Thanks for considering Aspose.

Aspose.Total Demos are updated after detailed investigation.

**Change Summary**

1\. An old bug is traced in **Spread Sheet Demo** (Excel.aspx) that caused the generation of incompleteÂ Excel file when a user tries to **Save** the work done on the Grid. It was due to some logical error in the demo that is fixed now.

2\. In **Word Processor Demo** (Word.aspx), when **Spell Check** button is clicked, it always showed a popup message to turn off popup blocker. It is also fixed.

3\. The **Installers** are configured to make the demos run more smoothly.

Please feel free to [download][1] the updated Aspose.Total-Northwind Demos in CS or VB.NET version.
