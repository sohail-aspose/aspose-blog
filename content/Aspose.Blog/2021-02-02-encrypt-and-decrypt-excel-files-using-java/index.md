MS Excel provides you with a wide range of features to keep and analyze the data seamlessly. You can perform computations, generate charts as well as define your custom logic using VBA modules. Knowing the importance of the data in spreadsheets, MS Excel allows you to protect the workbooks using encryption. Furthermore, you can password protect the Excel files to avoid unauthorized access. In accordance with that, this article covers **how to encrypt/decrypt and password-protect Excel files using Java**.

## Java API to Encrypt and Decrypt Excel Files {#Java-API-to-Encrypt-and-Decrypt-Excel-Files}

[Aspose.Cells for Java][6] is a powerful spreadsheet manipulation API that lets you create and manipulate Excel files seamlessly. Furthermore, it allows you to encrypt and decrypt the workbooks within a few lines of code. In addition, you can protect an Excel file with a password. Aspose.Cells for Java can either be downloaded as [JAR][7] or installed using the following Maven configurations.

## Encrypt Excel Files using Java {#Encrypt-Excel-Files-using-Java}

Aspose.Cells for Java provides the following encryption types for Excel 2003 files.

*   [XOR][8]
*   [COMPATIBLE][9] (Office 97/2000 compatible)
*   [ENHANCED CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER V1][10]
*   [STRONG CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVIDER][11]

However, 2007/2010 workbooks are encrypted using SHA and AES encryption techniques in the same way MS Excel does. The following are the steps to encrypt an Excel file using Aspose.Cells for Java.

*   Load the Excel file using [Workbook][12] class.
*   Set password using [Workbook.getSettings().setPassword(string)][13] method.
*   Encrypt Excel file using [Workbook.setEncryptionOptions(EncryptionType, int)][14] method.
*   Save the encrypted workbook using [Workbook.save(string)][15] method.

For demonstration, the following code sample shows how to encrypt an Excel file using Java.

## Decrypt Excel Files using Java {#Decrypt-Excel-Files-using-Java}

In order to decrypt an encrypted Excel file, you only need to provide its password and the rest will be handled by Aspose.Cells for Java. The following are the steps to decrypt an Excel file using Java.

*   Create an instance of [LoadOptions][16] class.
*   Specify the password using [LoadOptions.setPassword(string)][17] method.
*   Create an instance of the [Workbook][18] class and pass the file's path and [LoadOptions][19] object to its constructor.
*   Set password to _null_ using [Workbook.getSettings().setPassword(string)][20] method.
*   Once done, save the decrypted workbook using [Workbook.save(string)][21] method.

The following code sample shows how to decrypt a password-protected Excel file using Java.

## Verify Password of an Encrypted Excel File {#Verify-Password-of-Encrypted-Excel-File}

In addition to encryption/decryption, Aspose.Cells for Java also allows you to verify the password of a protected Excel file. The following are the steps to perform password verification.

*   Load the encrypted Excel file using [FileInputStream][22] class.
*   Use [FileFormatUtil.verifyPassword(FileInputStream, string)][23] method to verify the password.
*   As a result, if the return value is true then the password is valid else it is invalid.

The following code sample shows how to verify the password of an encrypted Excel file using Java.
