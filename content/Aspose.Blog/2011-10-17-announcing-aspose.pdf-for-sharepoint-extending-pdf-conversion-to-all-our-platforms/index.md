![Aspose.Pdf icon][1]

**Sydney, Australia - 17 October, 2011** \- Aspose.Pdf is one of Aspose's most popular products. The [Aspose.Pdf product family][2] already offers products for .NET, Java, SSRS and JasperReports. On all platforms, Aspose.Pdf helps developers convert files to PDF from within their applications, without having Adobe Acrobat installed.

[Aspose.Pdf for SharePoint][3] extends this functionality to yet another platform. Aspose.Pdf for SharePoint allows users to save lists, list items and Wiki pages in SharePoint to PDF files.

## Easy installation

Many of our users have reported how difficult other applications can be to install on SharePoint. They often have to install plug-ins or extensions more than once and then spent time on configuration before it works as expected. Aspose spend time ensuring that our SharePoint extensions don't have these problems. Instead, our installations are fast and work as expected. SharePoint applications are complex enough without us adding complications.

That is at the core of our development philosophy: to make file format tools that make other deverlopers' lives easier.

[Aspose.Pdf for SharePoint is available for download now][4].
