We are working to add “edit” capability to Aspose.Cells.Web.Viewer and upgrade it to Aspose.Cells.Web.

In the next formal release, you will be able to edit the content in the web page and post the data back to server. In the server, you can retrieve the data to a data object, such as a datatable. And you can save the changed data to an Excel file.

It will be available about on the mid of February.
