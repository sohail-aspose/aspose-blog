The release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET 5.0.0 provides support for reading Miscrosoft Project 2013 MPP formats. Aspose.Tasks now facilitates reading [general project properties][2], [calendar information][3], task and task link data, resource and resource assignment data, and outline codes and extended task attributes data for Microsoft Project 2013 formats.

This version also incorporates a new feature that lets you read a task's budget work and cost values from Microsoft Project 2007/2010 MPP files, that were not supported earlier. In addition, another new feature that lets you get the total number of pages for an MPP file, based on different TimeScale options has also been included in this month's release.

This months release also includes some internal bug fixes and improvements to various features, as can be seen from the [Product Release page][4].
