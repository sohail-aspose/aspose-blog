[![Aspose.Diagram for Java logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/aspose_diagram-for-java.png)We’re pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Diagram for Java 5.0.0. This minor release improves export quality of the Visio diagram to PDF and image file formats. It also addresses other shape manipulation improvements like assigning shape to a layer and setting TwoD property of the shape. This release includes the most recent bug fixes and advanced techniques of enhancements.

## Remove Additional White Spaces

During the export of Visio files to PDF or thumbnail format, the Aspose.Diagram API exporter was placing a few additional white space around the actual drawing or extra half ellipse shape.

*   VSD to PDF export, extra white space on the left and right side of the drawing
    
*   VSD to PNG export, extra white space on the left and right side of the drawing
    

## Layout Improvements

Aspose.Diagram for .NET is an easy to use API for converting, editing and manipulating complex Visio diagrams. This new release improves the placement accuracy of the shape's text item. In some cases, text items of the shapes were misplaced from their original position. We have fixed all these problematic areas.
