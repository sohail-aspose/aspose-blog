![Aspose.Words icon][1]

We just have made availableÂ our next monthly release that delivers Aspose.Words for .NET 10.2 and Aspose.Words for Java 10.2 again, with the same set of features and fixes in both products.

One of the great new features delivered is the correct layout of floating tables when converting documents to PDF and XPS. Earlier versions laid out floating tables as inline and that was causing problems to many customers.

We have also been testing latest Aspose.Words both .NET and Java versions on various Linux distrubutions and on Mac OS X successfully. You can create Java applications or use the Mono framework, Aspose.Words works great either way.
