**WordPress** is a free open source blogging tool and a content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL, which runs on a web hosting service. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system. WordPress is used by more than 22.0% of the top 10 million websites as of August 2013. WordPress is the most popular blogging system in use on the [Web][1], at more than 60 million websites. Itâ€™s probably the easiest and most powerful blogging and website content management system (or CMS) in existence today.

Aspose Importer / Exporter 2.0 plugin allows developers to read the contents of different documents like PDF, DOC, and DOCX without any other software such as Adobe Acrobat, a PDF Reader or Microsoft Word. This plugin also exports posts to PDF, DOC, and DOCX. Aspose Importer / Exporter demonstrates the powerful import & export feature provided by [Aspose.PDF][2] & [Aspose.Words][3]. It adds a simple **Aspose File Importer** button to posts & pages. When users click the button, they get two options: importing from a local file or from Aspose Cloud Storage. The user selects a file (PDF, DOC, or DOCX), and then either **Insert Text to Editor** or **Insert HTML to Editor**.

*   **Insert HTML to Editor** imports the file contents, with formatting.
*   **Insert Text to Editor** imports text from the file.

This plugin uses the WordPress media uploader to upload local files. You can also select files from WordPress media gallery.

For the export feature, the plugin works as a bulk action of posts, pages or custom post types. In bulk action, two new options - **Aspose PDF Exporter** and **Aspose DOC Exporter** - are added. When an option is selected, it generates a DOC or PDF file containing all selected posts or page content.
