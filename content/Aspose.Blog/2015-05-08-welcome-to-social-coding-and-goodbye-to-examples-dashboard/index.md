At [Aspose][1], we always strive to make sure our customers get the quality products along with the best in class help and support. As part of that endeavor, we provided Examples Dashboard, so our customers could run examples from a single place using Dashboard UI. But with experience, we have learned that our customers do not need a middle layer (like Examples Dashboard) between them and the the examples because they're the seasoned developers who love to play with the code directly.  
  
To keep our promise of delivering what makes our customers more productive and happier while working with our products, examples, and support material, we're moving towards [social coding][2]. We know that the enthusiastic developers, like you, would love to get their hands dirty with the code right off the social coding websites like [Github.com][3].  
  
That's why we're going to discontinue Examples Dashboard and instead we're reorganizing our code directly on social coding websites so you could directly download the code, fork the repositories, commit your own changes, and work in a collaborative way. This will also help us deliver new examples and exciting sample projects to our customers and seasoned developers quickly.  
  
From this month (May 2015), we'll discontinue Examples Dashboard and you'll be able to [get examples directly from Github.com][4]. So we would encourage you to stop using the Examples Dashboard to avoid any inconvenience and start working directly with the examples.  
  
We're here to help you succeed. In case you have any questions or need support, [our team is here to help][5].  
  
Happy coding!
