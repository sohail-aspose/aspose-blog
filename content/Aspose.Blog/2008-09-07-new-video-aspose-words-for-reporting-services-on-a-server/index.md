We are trying ourselves in making product and training videos. There are at least three short videos for an upcoming new version of Aspose.Words for Reporting Services planned. This is the first video about running AWRS on a server.

If you fancy 2 minutes listening to a guy (me) speaking English with a bit of Russian accent you can try.

Other than that we are looking to hear your feedback. Do you want more videos? What topics? Do you want them more professionally made?
