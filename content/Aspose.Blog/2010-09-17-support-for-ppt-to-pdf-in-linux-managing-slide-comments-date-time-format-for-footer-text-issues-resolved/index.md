We feel happy on presenting the new release of Aspose.Slides for Java 2.4.0. Now, one can add and remove the slide comments programmatically and can set the date time format for the footer text in PPT. PPT to PDF export problem in Unix/Linux environment has addressed along with the resolution of rendering of unsupported image types issue by simply skipping them.
