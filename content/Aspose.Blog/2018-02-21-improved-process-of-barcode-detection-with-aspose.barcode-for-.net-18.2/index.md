We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Barcode for .NET][1] 18.2. This is primarily a maintenance release whereby we have resolved certain issues incurring in API and some of which were reported by our valued customers. This release also supports the enhanced process of code text alignment with custom scaling.

## Enhancements

It was observed that text rendering is different on systems (having custom display scaling). In this release, the enhanced process of text rendering has been incorporated.

## Other Enhancements

This release also fixes exceptions that were reported by our valued customers. The complete list of fixes in this release is as follows.

*   The Barcode recognition process has been improved to detect barcodes from PDF files.
*   Functionality to recognize barcode from images has been enhanced. The functionality has been enhanced in such a way that if API encounters a situation in which metadata of barcode indicates that barcode has 19 lines but actually it has 18 lines. The algorithm will act accordingly and returns the correct recognition result.

To view a complete list of fixes, please visit the [release notes][2] page. You can access **Aspose.Barcode for .NET 18.2** through [Nuget Gallery][3].
