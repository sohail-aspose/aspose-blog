[![Aspose.Diagram for Java logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/aspose_diagram-for-java.png)We’re pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Diagram for Java 4.0.0. This release focuses more on the performance, flexible rendering and manipulation of Visio diagram elements. This release also improves visual appearance features by fixing error messages, bugs and including advanced techniques of enhancements.

## Flexible Shape Movement

The Aspose.Diagram for Java API ensures the flexible movement of shapes inside output Visio drawings. Recently, we noticed a few cases where customers were not able to move a shape using the mouse pointer. We have now fixed these anomalies.

## Complete Shape Appearance

Aspose.Diagram for .NET is an easy to use API for converting, editing and manipulating complex Visio diagrams. This new release improves the appearance of the supported output file formats. In some cases, shapes were not complete, had moved from the original position, had names were changed or had issues with property data. We have fixed all these problematic areas.
