[![][1]](https://products.aspose.com/tasks/net)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET 6.9.0. This month’s release includes enhancements to the existing API features in order to resemble the behavior of Microsoft Project. It also includes a number of bug fixes that were reported by our customers with the previous version. You can visit the [product download page][2] for detailed information about what is new and fixed, and share your feedback with us on the [Aspose.Tasks forum][3]. You can also view all public API changes in this latest version by visiting the Public API changes in Aspose.Tasks for .NET 6.9.0 section of the documentation.

## Enhanced Project Data Rendering

This month’s release brings a number of enhancements to project data rendering that enables users to get the same output from various aspects similar to Microsoft Project.

**Rendering Graphical Column Indicators -** Microsoft Project renders graphical indicators in columns while writing project data to output PDF or other formats. These include:

*   Task indicators
*   Resource indicators
*   Assignment indicators

These show a graphical depiction of status based on the value of the particular data available. This months’ release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET provides the same functionality by implementing all these graphical indicators which are rendered to output PDF or any other format while exporting Project data.

**Rendering Gantt Chart Lines in Gradient –** The new version of Aspose.Tasks allows developers to set the gradient color of lines when rendering project data to formats such as PDF. This was not supported by the earlier versions of Aspose.Tasks. The developer can control whether the output lines should have solid or gradient color using the Boolean flag provided in SaveOptions.

**Show/Hide Gantt Chart view –** Aspose.Tasks now supports rendering the task sheet view to other formats such as PDF, thus providing the capability to show/hide Gantt chart view.

## Other Improvements

This month’s release also includes a number of bug fixes reported with our previous version. This includes exceptions when loading specific MPP files, formatting loss when exporting project data to HTML, and missing title in the timeline view.
