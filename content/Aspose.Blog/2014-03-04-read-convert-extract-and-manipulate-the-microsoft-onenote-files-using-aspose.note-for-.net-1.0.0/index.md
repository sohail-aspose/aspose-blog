We are excited to announce our new API - [Aspose.Note for .NET][1]. It interacts with the Microsoft Office OneNote (.one) file format. Aspose.Note is a .NET class library to read, convert and parse Microsoft OneNote files using C#. It allows developers to work with ONE (2010/ 2013) files in C#, ASP.NET MVC, web services or any .NET based applications. Aspose.Note for .NET API brings with it some comprehensive features.

In the first version, we have included features like converting .one files to different image formats, exporting to PDF format, reading and extracting text from .one file, getting page information, getting image information, extracting images, and searching and replacing text. The following samples give you an idea of how to get started with Aspose.Note for .NET.
