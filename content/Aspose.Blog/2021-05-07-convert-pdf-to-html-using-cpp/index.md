## Convert PDF Documents to HTML Format with Additional Options using C++ {#Convert-PDF-Documents-to-HTML-Format-with-Additional-Options-using-CPP}

The Aspose.PDF for C++ API provides you the ability to customize the HTML generated by the conversion process. For this, the API offers the [HtmlSaveOptions][14] class. The following are some of the options provided by the [HtmlSaveOptions][15] class.

*   **[FontSavingMode][16]**: It is used to set the font saving mode used during the conversion. The [FontSavingModes][17] enum is used to set its value.
*   **[RasterImagesSavingMode][18]**: It is used to set how the raster images should be handled during the conversion. The [RasterImagesSavingModes][19] enum is used to set its value.
*   **[LettersPositioningMethod][20]**: It sets the positioning of letters in words. The [LettersPositioningMethods][21] enum is used to set its value.
*   **[SpecialFolderForAllImages][22]**: It is used to set the path where the images will be saved.
*   **[SplitIntoPages][23]**: It sets whether each page of the PDF should be converted as a separate HTML page or the whole document should be converted to a single HTML file.
*   **[SplitCssIntoPages][24]**: When [SplitIntoPages][25] is set to **true**, [SplitCssIntoPages][26] sets whether the CSS should be saved as a single file or as a separate file for each HTML page.

The following are the steps to convert a PDF document to HTML format with additional options.

*   Load the PDF document using the [Document][27] class.
*   Create an instance of the [HtmlSaveOptions][28] class.
*   Set the desired options.
*   Save the HTML output using the [Document->Save(System::String outputFileName, System::SharedPtr<SaveOptions> options)][29] method.

The following is the C++ sample code that demonstrates the use of the [HtmlSaveOptions][30] class to customize the HTML output.
