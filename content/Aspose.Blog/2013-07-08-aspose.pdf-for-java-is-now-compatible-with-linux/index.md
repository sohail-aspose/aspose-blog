When we started migrating Aspose.Pdf for .NET to Java, we tried our level best to deliver a robust and powerful component that can provide the same set of features that are available on .NET. In the previous releases, the component did not work well on Linux. We are very much excited to announce this maintenance release, Aspose.Pdf for Java 4.1.2, which provides compatibility with Linux.

During our testing, we have ensured that Aspose.Pdf for Java is compatible with the major Linux flavors, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.7 and Debian6 Linux.

This release also includes some fixes regarding PDF to raster image conversion.
