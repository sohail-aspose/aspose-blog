Added a new code example to the API Reference and to Wiki about how to combine documents: http://www.aspose.com/wiki/default.aspx/Aspose.Words/ExSectionCombineDocuments.html

The new thing about this example is that it comes in three languages:

*   C#
*   VB.NET
*   Java

It is a start of the things to come. Soon, all examples will automatically come in three languages. The API Reference for Aspose.Words for Java will also be much more useful soon.
