We are pleased to announce the new release version of [Aspose.BarCode for Java][1] 7.1.0. This minor release only covers two fixes. In the first case, our client was not able to encode Code128 barcode with FNC 3 character. It was the problem only with Aspose Java platform library. Â The second case is about the color index which was out of the range at specific byte. This problem occurred when our client was generating QR code in the GIF file format.
