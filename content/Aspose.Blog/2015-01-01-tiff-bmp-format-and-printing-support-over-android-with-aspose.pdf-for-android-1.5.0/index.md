We are very much excited to announce the release of [Aspose.PDF for Android 1.5.0][1] which provides new features and enhancements in API which are natively not supported by the Android platform. Rendering of PDF files to various image formats (raster images) has been supported by Aspose.PDF for Java for quite some time and as Aspose.PDF for Android is developed on top of Aspose.PDF for Java, similar features are ported to this Android API as well. One of the salient features introduced in this release is the conversion of PDF to Tiff and vice versa. The **TiffDevice** class can be used to get these capabilities. This new release also offers the feature to convert PDF documents to BMP format using the **BmpDevice** class.

## Print PDF Files in Android

The latest release includes a class named **PdfViewer** which provides the capabilities to print PDF documents. As we know that Android does not have any standard functionality for printing but Google provides ["Cloud Printing"][2] tool which may be used for this purpose. Also, please note that [Google Printing recommends][3] using PDF documents for better results, so with the help of Aspose.PDF for Android, you can convert most of your resource files to PDF format and then try using Google printing for this purpose.

Furthermore, if your requirement is to print a certain range of pages, you can use our API to select the particular page range and they try using the above-stated instructions to print the documents.

In this new version, the table and Graph objects rendering features are one of the key improvement areas. Please download and start evaluating the new release of [Aspose.PDF for Android 1.5.0][4]
