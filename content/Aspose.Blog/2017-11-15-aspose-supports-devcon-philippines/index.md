Developers Connect Philippines (DevCon)** is a non-proﬁt organization which aims to promote the "IT Pinoy Talent" mainly by providing a unique venue for IT students, educators, professionals and enthusiasts to __Sync, Support and Succeed.  
__

DevCon was founded in June 26, 2009.

DevCon is a pioneering project of the Philippine Software Industry Association (PSIA). Its pilot event, DevCon Visayas, was held at the TechBar in Cebu City. DevCon also spanned a ten-city nationwide tour as part of the Next Wave Cities roadshow run by the then Commission on Information and Communications Technology (CICT) and Business Processing Association of the Philippines (BPA/P) in 2009.

To increase its reach, DevCon has signed a partnership with the Philippine Society of IT Educators (PSITE) to make DevCon accessible to IT students nationwide. Furthermore, to ensure that DevCon's presence will continue to grow, DevCon registered under the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non-profit organization.
