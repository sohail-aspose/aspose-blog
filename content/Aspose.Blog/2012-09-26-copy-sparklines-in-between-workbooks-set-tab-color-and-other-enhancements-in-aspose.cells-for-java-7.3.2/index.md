[![Aspose.Cells logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/05/aspose.cells-logo2.jpg)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Cells for Java 7.3.2. In this release we have added support for copying [sparklines][2] between workbooks. We also made an important enhancement regarding obtaining the offset of the right-bottom corner of a given shape. Users can now set the default color of the worksheet tab. Moreover, several important customer issues have been rectified. Many important issues with reading and writing Microsoft Excel files, manipulating charts and exporting to PDF have been resolved in this release. We have also made an enhancement, so that you can close internal streams to release memory resources in PDF conversion and boost performance.
