## 10 years in business and a new home page

In March, Aspose turned ten. We're continuing to celebrate our tenth birthday this year and will introduce you to some of our very first users in the coming months. We're also collecting stories about your experience of working with Aspose. If you have a story you want to share, [please email us][1]. We're interested in hearing how your work has changed over the last 10 years, and how you have used our tools. Are you still using one of our very first products or have you only recently started working with us? We're curious and want to know. There will be a reward for the best story.

Many thanks,  
Danny Cooper, Aspose Texas Team Leader

### Migration Tip – Creating a New Diagram with Aspose.Diagram for .NET

[](https://docs.aspose.com/display/cadnet/Home)One of Aspose's goals is to free developers from dependence on Office Automation. To create a new Microsoft Visio diagram, for example, you can use VSTO or Aspose.Diagram. This migration tip compares the two approaches and we hope you'll agree that the Aspose.Diagram method is rather more elegant. [Read the migration tip][7].
