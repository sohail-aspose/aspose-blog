We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET 8.7.0. This month’s release includes new features, enhancements, and other API improvements as a result of a number of bug fixes. You may visit our [product download page][2] to have further details about what is new and fixed. For a list of public API changes, please visit our documentation section Public API Changes.

# New Features and Enhancements

**Reading Project Data from Microsoft Project Database:** This month’s release introduces an exciting new feature of reading Project data from Microsoft Project Database. The _SqlConnectionStringBuilder_ class can be used to set database connection parameters. The overloaded construction of Project class can be used for setting database parameters and load the project data from Microsoft Project database.

**Support for Microsoft Project 2016 Format:** Microsoft Project 2016 has been released and its preview version is already available for [download][3]. We are pleased to share that Aspose.Tasks for .NET API already supports this version of Microsoft Project format as it is based on the 2013 MPP file format. The API has been tested with the new format of the MPP file and it has passed all the tests regarding the 2016 format properties reading.

**Support for Risk Analysis:** This month’s release also includes a new feature of performing risk analysis on a Project data file. This is based on the Monte Carlo simulation that supports different probability distributions and correlations. The _Aspose.Tasks.RiskAnalysis.RiskAnalyzer_ class can be used to perform the risk analysis that is based on a project schedule (task durations and their start/finish dates). So, a project Finish date can be the output of such analysis. This process includes the following four steps:

1.  Prepare Analysis Settings
2.  Identifying the Input of Analysis
3.  Analyze the Risks
4.  Use the Results of the Analysis

A detailed example of using this feature can be found in our documentation article, Risk Analysis Tool.

# Other Improvements

This month’s release also includes a number of bug fixes that further add to the overall functionality and quality of the API. These include issues related to saving project while using Gantt Chart view, saving project data to PDF and loading certain MPX files.

As always, we welcome your feedback and queries over Aspose.Tasks [Support forum][4]. Please feel free to contact us for your technical inquiries.
