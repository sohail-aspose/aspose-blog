We have published the latest version of Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET. In Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET 4.9.0, we have improved PdfConverter, PdfExtractor, PdfViewer and PdfFileMend classes. Memory utilization has been improved for adding images in the PDF file. We have also worked on PDF printing and improved the quality of the printed output along with enhancing the printing performance. In addition to that, we have fixed an issue related to orientation of the printed output.  
  
PDF to image conversion is enhanced quite a bit. We have improved the text and image rendering while converting the PDF pages to images, so that the images and text from the source PDF file are converted to the output images properly. Text extraction is also enhanced in this version. We have also introduced a new field type named Barcode in FieldType enumeration.
