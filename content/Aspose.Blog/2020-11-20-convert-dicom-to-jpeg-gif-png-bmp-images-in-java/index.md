**Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ([DICOM][1]** is the standard for the communication and management of medical imaging information and related data. But you need a dedicated software to view a DICOM file and you cannot simply embed them in presentations or webpages. To tackle this limitation, you can convert a DICOM file to raster image formats such as [JPEG][2], [GIF][3], [PNG][4], and [BMP][5]. In this article, you will learn how to **convert a DICOM** file **programmatically** in **Java**.

## Java DICOM Converter API {#Java-DICOM-Converter-API}

[Aspose.Imaging for Java][12] is a powerful image creation and manipulation API that lets you convert DICOM file to JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and [PDF][13] with high fidelity. You can either [download][14] the APIâ€™s [JAR][15] or install it within your Maven-based applications using the following configurations.

## DICOM to JPEG in Java {#Convert-DICOM-to-JPEG-in-Java}

The following are the steps to convert DICOM to JPEG in Java:

*   Load the DICOM file into a [DicomImage][16] object from the specified file path.
*   Select the active page in DICOM that you want to convert to JPEG (if it is not set, the default active page will be converted).
*   Save the converted JPEG image using [DicomImage.save(String filePath, ImageOptionsBase options)][17] method.

The following code sample converts a page in DICOM to JPEG in Java.

## DICOM to GIF in Java {#Convert-DICOM-to-GIF-in-Java}

The steps to convert DICOM to GIF are same as we used above to convert DICOM to JPEG. Just access the DICOM file and save it with **.gif** extension. The following are the steps to convert DICOM to animated GIF in Java:

*   Load the DICOM file into a [DicomImage][18] object from the specified file path.
*   Save the converted GIF image using [DicomImage.save(String filePath, ImageOptionsBase options)][19] method.

The following code sample shows how to convert DICOM to GIF in Java.

## DICOM to PNG in Java {#Convert-DICOM-to-PNG-in-Java}

As you may have guessed already, the steps to convert DICOM to PNG are same as used above to perform other conversions. Simply access the DICOM file using [DicomImage][20] class and save it with **.png** extension. If it is required to convert each page in a DICOM file to PNG, simply call [DicomImage.getDicomPages()][21] function to get **DicomPage\[\]** array and iterate over it as shown below.

The following code example shows how to convert a DICOM to PNG in Java.

## DICOM to BMP in Java {#Convert-DICOM-to-BMP-in-Java}

Converting DICOM to BMP is as simple as pie. Access the DICOM file using the [DicomImage][22] class and use [DicomImage.save(String filePath, ImageOptionsBase options)][23] method to save DICOM as BMP. The following code sample shows how to convert DICOM to BMP in Java.

## DICOM to PDF in Java {#DICOM-to-PDF-in-Java}

PDF is one of the most popular file formats. So, it is important to know how to transform a DICOM file to PDF in Java. The following code sample explains how to make this conversion.

## Conclusion

In this article, you have learned how to convert DICOM file to JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and PDF in Java. You have also seen how to set an active page and convert all pages of a DICOM file. Please check the [documentation][24] to learn more about **Aspose.Imaging** API.
