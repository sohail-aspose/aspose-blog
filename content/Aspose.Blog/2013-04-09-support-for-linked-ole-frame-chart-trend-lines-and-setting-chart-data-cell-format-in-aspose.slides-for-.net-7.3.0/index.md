![Aspose.Slides icon][1]

We have released Aspose.Slides for .NET 7.3.0.

This new release has enriched Aspose.Slides support for MSO charts. Now, one can add different types of trend lines in Aspose generated MSO charts. For more details about the feature support, please read about adding chart trend lines. We have also introduced support for setting the chart data cell number format. For more details about the issue, please read about setting number formats for chart data cells. We have added the support for long awaited Linked Ole Frame support as well in this new release. You can find more details about this feature in the OLE object frames article.

We  have also resolved certain presentation rendering issues including thumbnail generation and PDF export. Certain chart and SmartArt shape rendering issues have also been resolved. Some presentation access issues have also been mitigated.
