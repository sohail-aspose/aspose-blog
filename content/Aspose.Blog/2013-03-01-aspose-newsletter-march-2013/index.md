## Growing the Community

Just under three years ago, Aspose celebrated 100,000 registered users. We were delighted to have such a large and active community. Now, we're getting very close to doubling that number. Like last time, we'll celebrate this milestone with a great prize for user number 200,000. We're also giving our users another 19 prizes. Every day takes us closer to reaching 200,000 registered users and we expect to announce the winner in the next newsletter. Thank you to everyone in our community for your support and feedback.

In January, we ran a sweepstake where the prize was a Developer Small Business license for Aspose.Diagram, Aspose.OCR and Aspose.Imaging. The winner was Enrico Keil, of [Keil IT][1], a German company that provides a variety of IT solutions to their customers. They also design BarcodeOCR, software that automates barcode reading and document processing. Congratulations Enrico!

### Migration Tip – Linking Tasks with VSTO or Aspose.Tasks for .NET

![Migration tip icon][15]Tasks in Microsoft Project files often depend on other tasks - they are linked.
