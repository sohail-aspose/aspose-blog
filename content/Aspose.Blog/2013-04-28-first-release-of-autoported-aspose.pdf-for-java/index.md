![Aspose.Pdf icon][1]

Another feather in the crown. We are very much excited to announce the first release version of the autoported version of Aspose.Pdf for Java. This is a perfect time to rejoice and state that our Java product line is as robust in terms of features as its sibling .NET product line. When we look back into the history of Aspose.Pdf, we find that in July 2011, we introduced the first merged API release version of Aspose.Pdf for .NET. This enabled our customers to use a single component to create and manipulate existing PDF files.

Over the years, we have been trying to further strengthen our .NET product and at the same time, we also have been working on porting Aspose.Pdf for .NET features to the Java platform, just to ensure that our Java customers get the same set of features and can play with PDF objects. Now the time has come and we are pleased to present the first release of the autoported Aspose.Pdf for Java. This product is enriched and offers the same quality standards as its ancestors.

Please check out the details about this new exciting release: [Aspose.Pdf for Java 4.0.0][2].
