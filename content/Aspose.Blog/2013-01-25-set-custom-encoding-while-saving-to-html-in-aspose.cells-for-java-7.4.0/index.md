Aspose.Cells for Java 7.4.0 has been released. This month’s release supports specifying a custom encoding type when saving to HTML. Since our Java version is auto-ported from .NET, almost every feature and enhancement that is included in [the new .NET version][1] are duplicated in the corresponding Java version. In this release, some issues pertaining to charts and formula calculation engine have also been addressed and corrected.
