We are proud to share the release announcement of Aspose.Slides for Android via Java 18.9. This is one of major releases whereby we have included support for rendering slide images, exporting to PDF, SVG and HTML.

## Create Slide's Thumbnail using Java

To generate the thumbnail of any desired slide using Aspose.Slides for Java:

1.  Create an instance of the `Presentation` class.
2.  Obtain the reference of any desired slide by using its ID or index.
3.  Get the thumbnail image of the referenced slide on a specified scale.
4.  Save the thumbnail image in any desired image format.

The following code sample shows how to generate a thumbnail for presentation's slide using Java.
