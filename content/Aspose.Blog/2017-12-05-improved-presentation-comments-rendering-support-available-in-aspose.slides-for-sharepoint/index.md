[![Aspose.Slides for SharePoint logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/aspose-Slides-for-SharePoint_100.png)We are pleased to share the release announcement of Aspose.Slides for SharePoint 17.11.

This release has been developed based on Aspose.Slides for .NET 17.11, which has support for some new features including support for End Paragraph Run properties and improved presentation comments rendering support in generated thumbnails and PDF. The presentation rendering support has also been improved and this will help in converting presentations to different formats including images, PDF and XPS when using Aspose.Slides for SharePoint.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for SharePoint 17.11 Release Notes][2] for further reference.
