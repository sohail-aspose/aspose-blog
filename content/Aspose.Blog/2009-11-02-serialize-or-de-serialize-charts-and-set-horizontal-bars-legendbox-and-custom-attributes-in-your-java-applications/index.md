Aspose.Report for Java 1.1.0 has been released. This release includes some important features and enables you to serialize the chart to XML and load the chart from XML. LegendBox is an important item of a chart and this release provides the ability to create a LegendBox and set its attributes.

Custom attributes can be used to set various attributes of a series e.g. you can set the bar width rate, shape of the bar (Cone or Cylinder etc), if the bar will be stacked or side by side and some other important attributes.
