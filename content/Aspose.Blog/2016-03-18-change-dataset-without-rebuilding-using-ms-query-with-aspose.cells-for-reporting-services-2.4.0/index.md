[![Aspose.Cells for SSRS icon][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Cells-for-SSRS-e1377591440623.png)We are happy to announce the release of Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services 2.4.0. This is basically a maintenance release which contains an important feature and some useful fixes. We have added a new feature for changing dataset without rebuilding the entire dataset using MS Query.

## Change DataSet without rebuilding the entire DataSet using MS Query

Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services does support both report specific data sources and shared data sources created on Report Server in advance. The component now allows you make changes to the dataset without rebuilding the entire dataset using MS Query and without having to re-layout the entire report.

You will follow the following steps with the new version:

*   Open report definition file with Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services Client in MS Excel.
*   Click **Build DataSet** button.
*   Select dataset node and click edit button.
*   Update **SQL** command and click **Update** button to update fields.

## Other Enhancements and Fixes

In this release, some issues have been addressed. For example, an issue regarding installation has been fixed. We have also resolved another issue regarding inserting and formatting rows and columns.
