Display report Header/Title before the Table Of Contents is placed inside PDF document. This amazing feature has been introduced in the latest release version of Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services as in earlier versions, you only had the capability to place TOC in first page. We know this product supports the capability to render PDF documents from Report Viewer and now we have also added a new feature to hide the Report Viewer while rendering the PDF document. More along, in order to unify the license mechanism, this release version also supports Aspose.Total.Product.Family.lic scheme so now if you have this license file, you can use it with Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services along with other products. Please be the first to download the latest release version from [this link][1].
