## Aspose Java for NetBeans - Aspose Project Wizard 2.3 released!

Aspose has released its NetBeans IDE plugin, Aspose Project Wizard 2.3, which now integrates  examples of Aspose.Words for Java code and a features comparison with Apache POI WP.

With this integration you now don't need to manually download the **[Aspose Java APIs code comparison examples with Apache POI framework][1]** as they are now available through the plugin's **Aspose New Example wizard** within NetBeans IDE.

Comparison examples shows side by side code comparison for features available in both Aspose.Words and Apache POI-HWPF & POI-XWPF and further highlighting many features that are only available in Aspose Java APIs.

## How to Create the Aspose.Words Features Comparison Example with Apache POI within NetBeans

1.  Create an Aspose application using the Aspose Project wizard (detailed steps are mentioned in previous Aspose blog post). In the wizard, select Aspose.Words component like shown in below snap shot: ![Aspose Project Wizard][2]
2.  Create new Aspose example from the **New File** option in NetBeans (detailed steps are mentioned in previous Aspose blog post).
3.  Select the Aspose.Words component from the selection box.  
    Examples are downloaded and will appear in tree format including Aspose.Words code comparison examples with Apache POI WP as shown in below snapshot:![](http://i.imgur.com/nve3YAb.png)
4.  Select an example and click **Finish**: ![](http://i.imgur.com/MXaEfos.png)This starts downloading the selected example dependencies, that is, the Apache POI framework library jars.
