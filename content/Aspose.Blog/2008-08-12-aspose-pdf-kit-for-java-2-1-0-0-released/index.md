In this release, new features of importing and exporting PDF bookmarks with XML files are supported. Extracting and importing annotations are also exciting new features, by which merging comments from multiple PDF files to one PDF file is possible. In form-disposing, the mechanism for manipulating ComboBox/RadioBox/CheckBox is improved, as well as the interfaces for filling form. Furthermore, new classes are added to enhance the capability to support JavaScript and Action features.
