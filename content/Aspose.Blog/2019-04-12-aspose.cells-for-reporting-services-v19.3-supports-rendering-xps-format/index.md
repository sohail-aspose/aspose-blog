At least Windows users won't deny the advantages of XPS (The XML Paper Specification) format. Forget if it is a paginated fixed-layout format that retains the look and feel of your documents. But, being a shape of electronic paper, the XPS format provides a better way in which you can easily create, share and print digital documents. And, above all, XPS documents can be neither manipulated nor edited easily and can only be viewed on computer systems that have an XPS Viewer installed.

## Render your report definition file to XPS

While working in report server to transform report data and layout information into XPS, you might think why SQL Server Reporting Services did not include this format as one of their built-in rendering extension. No worries, Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services is here to cope with it and now it supports the format. Here is a document to check the complete list of [supported document formats][1].

To use this useful feature and avail other enhancements, I would recommend you to try the release [Aspose.Cells for Reporting Services 19.3][2]. And, if you have a little time, browse [Developers' Guide][3] for your complete reference on what you can deliver using the rendering extension [API][4]. You are always welcome to share your review, concerns or feedback on [forums][5].
