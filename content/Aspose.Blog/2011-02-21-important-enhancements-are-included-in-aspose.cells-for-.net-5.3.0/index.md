We have released the Aspose.Cells for .NET v5.3.0 for the users. In this version, we have made several enhancements for the following features:

*   Chart-to-Image
*   Excel-to-PDF
*   R/W ODS files
*   Auto-fit rows

 The web control provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET now supports all the features on FireFox browser too. You can convert list collection to DataTable object. We have included SMALL formula to the supported formulas list. Moreover, the control now can load Excel files having auto-filters enabled.  There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
