While trying to keep the API as straightforward and clear as possible, we have decided to recognize and honor the common development practices of the platform; we have re-arranged API Structure/ Namespaces.

  

With the release i.e.., [Aspose.Cells for .NET v5.0.0][1], we have reorganized the API classes for Aspose.Cells component. This change has some major aspects that we follow. We have added new namespaces. The entire API (classes, interfaces, enumerations, structures etc.) were previously located in the Aspose.Cells namespace. Now, certain sets of API have been moved to their relative namespaces, which make the relationship of classes (with their members) and namespaces clear and simplified.

  

All the classes of Aspose.Cells library are split into appropriate namespaces for easy access. The Aspose.Cells namespace is of course the root namespace that provides classes for generating, converting, modifying, rendering and printing Microsoft Excel documents without utilizing Microsoft Excel. The Aspose.Cells component has the following namespaces:

*   Aspose.Cells
*   Aspose.Cells.Charts
*   Aspose.Cells.Drawing
*   Aspose.Cells.Rendering
*   Aspose.Cells.Pivot
*   Aspose.Cells.Tables
*   Aspose.Cells.Properties
