Hot fix contains:  

*   New: Optimized reading and changing presentations by speed. Especially slide cloning.
*   Fixed: Cloning slides with connector autoshapes.
*   Fixed: Drawing some autoshapes.
*   Fixed: 'null reference' exception when read presentations with non-standard SummaryInformation stream.
*   Fixed: Slide.ChangeMaster function. If shape had default style inherited from master (like holders do) then solid border could appear.
