Aspose Team is pleased to announce the new release Aspose.PDF for C++ 17.11. In the second major release of Aspose.PDF for C++ API, we have added new improvements and enhancements to further improve the functionality and feature set of the API. In the previous [17.10 release of Aspose.PDF for C++ API][1], some issues were noticed which have been fixed in [Aspose.PDF for C++ 17.11][2] release. In order to get an overview of what we have changed and enhanced in the API, please refer to the [release notes][3] of the API.

You may have noticed in the release notes of Aspose.Pdf for C++ 17.11 that we have added more code snippets to the classes of the Aspose.Pdf for C++ as well as descriptions of the classes from namespaces. We always intend to provide more reliable and efficient API for C++ platform, so we make sure that all features offered by the existing classes and methods of the API, are comprehensive and properly listed.
