[![Aspose.Tasks for Java][1]](http://www.aspose.com/java/project-management-component.aspx)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Tasks for Java 6.4.0.

This month’s release includes a new feature that lets you export project data to the Primavera file format. Projects data can be exported to Primavera 6 XER and Primavera 6 XML formats. Just couple of lines of code are required to load a Microsoft Project’s MPP or XML files and export the data to both these formats.

Bugs related to recurring tasks detection are fixed and overall performance of the API is improved in this month’s release. For more information on what is new and fixed, please refer to the [product download page][2].
