## Find and Replace Text in Visio Diagram Programmatically in Java {#section2}

You may find and replace text in a VSD VSDX format Visio file with the steps below:

1.  Create a collection of the strings to search and replace text.
2.  Load the source Visio diagram file and loop through text in each shape.
3.  Write the output Visio diagram file.

The code sample below shows how to find and replace text in a Visio file programmatically using Java:



## Conclusion

In conclusion, you have understood how to find and replace text in Visio diagrams. You can also improvise the code snippet to work with other overloads of the replace method. For instance, replacing all instances of matching text or only the first occurrence of the search term in the Visio file. You can visit the [documentation][6] space to learn several other features to manipulate or convert MS Visio files.
