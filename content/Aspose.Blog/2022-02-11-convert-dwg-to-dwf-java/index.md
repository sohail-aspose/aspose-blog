[DWG][1] is a native format for several CAD applications as they store two or three-dimensional design data and metadata. Some applications or workflow requirements may need to convert a DWG file to a [DWF][2] file. Accordingly, this article explains how to convert a DWG file to a DWF format programmatically in Java.

## DWG to DWF Conversion – Java API Installation

[Aspose.CAD for Java][5] API can be used to work with DWG or other [file formats][6]. You can access the API by downloading its JAR file from the [New Releases][7] section or from [Aspose Repository][8] with the below configurations in the pom.xml file of your application:

### Repository```
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>AsposeJavaAPI</id>
        <name>Aspose Java API</name>
        <url>http://repository.aspose.com/repo/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

### Dependency```
 <dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
        <artifactId>aspose-cad</artifactId>
        <version>21.11</version>        
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Convert DWG to DWF Programmatically in Java

You can convert a DWG file to DWF file format with the steps listed below:

1.  Load the input DWG file with the [Image][9] class.
2.  Cast the Image class object to [CadImage][10] type.
3.  Convert DWG to DWF file using the [Save][11] method.

The following code snippet explains how to convert a DWG file to DWF format programmatically in Java:



## Explore More Features

You can learn to work with different CAD file formats by taking a look at the [documentation][12] section. It contains all the details for integrating different features in your applications.

## Conclusion

In this article, you have explored all the details about DWG to DWF file conversion.  Furthermore, you do not need to install any UI or application to perform the file conversion. The API is sufficient and capable of creating or processing CAD files on its own. However, if you need to discuss your requirements or need assistance to create a POC, please feel free to write to us at the [forum][13].
