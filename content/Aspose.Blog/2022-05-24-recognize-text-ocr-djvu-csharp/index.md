## Text Recognition from DjVu Image – C# API Installation {#section1}

[Aspose.OCR for .NET][4] API supports optical character recognition for different types of documents like JPG, PNG, PDF, etc. Likewise, it also supports text recognition from multipage DjVu image files. You can easily configure the API by downloading the JAR file of the API from the [Downloads][5] section. Likewise, you can run the following [NuGet][6] installation command to install the library in your project:

```

```

## Recognize Text by Performing OCR on DjVu Image in C# {#section2}

You can recognize text by performing OCR operations on multiple page DjVu images by following the steps below:

1.  Initialize an API instance using the [AsposeOCR][7] class.
2.  Create a [DocumentRecognitionSettings][8] class object.
3.  Recognize text using the [RecognizeDjvu][9] method.
4.  Print the recognized text.

The following code sample shows how to recognize text from a DjVu image by performing OCR programmatically in C#:
