Please welcome new release of our Aspose.Slides for Reporting Services product.  
  
This release contains new high fidelity rendering engine which now supports reports of any complexity with nested tables, groups, lists and etc. To implement it we had to give up using native MS PowerPoint tables because they are very limited by content. All tables, groups, matrices and other complex objects rendered now as set of shapes and text frames. Engine was written almost from scratch. The only code inherited from the first release is assembly attributes. Created presentations in most cases look absolutely identical to TIFF/PDF reports created with standard SQL Server rendering extensions.  
  
Only manual installation (zip file with .dll and documentation) available for SQL Server 2005. Updated automatic MSI installer will be available later.
