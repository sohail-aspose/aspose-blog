## About EndGame



{{< figure align=center src="images/1_6lz-rIuBnoKXv2nvWDk1hQ@2x.png" alt="End Game company logo">}}


[EndGame][1] is a software business development house specializing in cloud applications. We love designing, planning, and building great products leveraging our skills in rapid productization, business architecture, and Software as a Service (SaaS) operations.

Our DNA is to design well, build well, and invest well. For our customers, this looks like beautiful products that are outstanding to use, elegantly engineered, and empower them to achieve what they thought was impossible. To us, it looks like fun.

In such a fast-paced industry, we need to be working as smartly and efficiently as possible. Perpetually in front of us is the challenge to be scalable and responsive, providing the best ways to exceed our customers’ needs.

## Problem

A recent project required us to build an application to manage loan portfolios. Part of the challenge was to automatically email loan statements as PDFs each month to borrowers, based on a .docx template that could be modified by our customer. This meant we needed the ability to substitute fields and hide/show sections in the template depending on the status of the loan.

Loan details and payment information are added via a modal. Loan history and important information are displayed for the customer

## Solution

[Aspose.Words for .NET][2] has the ability to manipulate static data and tables in a Word document. We were able to automate and simplify the process of inserting the data pertinent to the loan statement into a Word document and [export as a PDF][3]. Users became able to see a polished PDF of their loan statement, and our customers managed to use Microsoft Word to do their own customizing.

## **Experience**

### **Finding a solution**

Before selecting [Aspose.Words for .NET][4], we looked at using other solutions to produce PDFs. We also have used PDF creation components in the past, but they did not work with Word templates. We explored the Microsoft OpenXML SDK, but it didn’t have the same level of flexibility as [Aspose.Words for .NET][5] and couldn’t export to PDF.

### **Implementation**

We were able to implement [Aspose.Words for .NET][6] in less than a week and found the [online help][7] to be very good. Our junior staff was raving about how great it was to use.

### **Outcome**

While using [Aspose.Words for .NET][8], we were able to produce loan statements in a very flexible way using Word templates. Our users managed to customize their own loan statements or add seasonal messages to the loan statement. We are looking forward to using [Aspose.Words for .NET][9] on more projects.

## Next Steps

After the success of this use case, we are going to use the same solution for producing invoices, purchase orders, quotes, and other documents. As an interesting upcoming development, we will use Aspose and Docusign to produce a document containing information submitted by the user and allow the user to digitally sign it.

## Summary

We are very pleased with the success of our [Aspose.Words for .NET][10] implementation. [Aspose.Words for .NET][11] is a very powerful development tool that is well [documented][12] and fast to learn. Using it helped us to automatically [produce PDFs][13] in a way that is flexible and customizable to our customers instead of locking us into one PDF design and layout. We would happily recommend [Aspose][14] to our customers and to other developers.
