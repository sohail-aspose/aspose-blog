## Create a PDF File in Java {#Create-a-PDF-File-using-Java}

The following are the steps to generate a simple PDF file from scratch and insert a piece of text in it.

*   Create an instance of [Document][13] class.
*   Add a new page using [Document.getPages().add()][14] method and get its reference in [Page][15] object.
*   Add text to the page using [Page.getParagraphs().add(new TextFragment("Hello World!"))][16] method.
*   Save the PDF file using [Document.save(String)][17] method.

The following code sample shows how to create a PDF file using Java.

## Create PDF File with Text Formatting in Java {#Apply-Text-Formatting-in-PDF-File}

Let's now check out how to apply formatting to the text in the PDF document. The text formatting could include font, font size, color, position, and etc. The following are the steps to perform this operation.

*   Use [Document][18] class to create a new PDF document or load an existing one.
*   Access the [Page][19] you want to place the text on.
*   Create an object of [TextFragment][20] to set the text and other formatting options such as position, font, color, size, etc.
*   Use the [TextBuilder][21] class to add the _TextFragment_ object to the page.
*   Use the [Document.save(String)][22] method to save the PDF document.

The following code sample shows how to create a PDF file and apply text formatting using Java.

## Generate PDF Files with Image using Java {#Insert-an-Image-in-PDF-File}

The following are the steps to insert an image in a PDF file using Aspose.PDF for Java.

*   Create a [Document][23] object to create or open the PDF document.
*   Get the page you want to add an image to in the [Page][24] object.
*   Add the image into the [Page.getResources()][25] collection.
*   Use operators to place the image on the page:
    *   [GSave][26] operator to save the current graphical state.
    *   [ConcatenateMatrix][27] operator to specify where the image is to be placed.
    *   [Do][28] operator to draw the image on the page.
    *   Finally, use the [GRestore][29] operator to save the updated graphical state.
*   Save the PDF file.

The following code sample shows how to insert image in a PDF file using Java.

## Insert a Table in PDF File using Java {#Create-a-Table-in-PDF-File-using-Java}

The table is a fine way of organizing the data in the form of rows and columns. Aspose.PDF lets you insert a table in a PDF document quite easily. The following are the steps to create a table.

*   Initialize a [Table][31] and set its columns and rows.
*   Set table's setting (e.g. borders).
*   Populate the table by adding rows into it.
*   Add the table to a page.
*   Save the PDF file.

The following code sample shows how to create a table in PDF files using Java.

## Create Form in a PDF File using Java {#Add-Form-in-PDF-File}

The PDF format also supports adding forms to collect input from the users. The form may contain various types of fields such as text boxes, radio buttons, etc. The following steps demonstrate how to insert a simple form in the PDF file.

*   Load the PDF document or create a new one using [Document][32] class.
*   Create the form field that you want to add such as [TextBoxField][33].
*   Set properties of the field.
*   Add the field to the [Form][34] of the PDF using [pdfDocument.getForm().add(Field, Int)][35] method.
*   Save the PDF document.

The following code sample shows how to create form in a PDF file using Java.
