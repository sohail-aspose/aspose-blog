summary: 'Contacts are an essential part of any email client as they facilitate the user by remembering all their contacts, similar to the contacts on your smartphone. Outlook contacts store a lot of information regarding a person, such as their name, address, contact number, email address, etc. These contacts can be stored in [MSG][1] and [VCF][2] formats. You might find yourself in scenarios where you need to create or alter MSG or VCF contacts programmatically. For that, this article will teach you **how to work with MSG and VCF** **contacts using C++**.'

Contacts are an essential part of any email client as they facilitate the user by remembering all their contacts, similar to the contacts on your smartphone. Outlook contacts store a lot of information regarding a person, such as their name, address, contact number, email address, etc. These contacts can be stored in [MSG][3] and [VCF][4] formats. You might find yourself in scenarios where you need to create or alter MSG or VCF contacts programmatically. For that, this article will teach you **how to work with MSG and VCF** **contacts using [C++][5]**.

## C++ API for Working with MSG and VCF Contacts {#CPP-API-for-Working-with-MSG-and-VCF-Contacts}

[Aspose.Email for C++][11] is a native C++ library for creating, manipulating, and sending emails without requiring Microsoft Outlook to be installed. The API also supports working with contacts and calendars. You can either install the API through [NuGet][12] or download it directly from the [Downloads][13] section.

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.Email.Cpp
```

## Create MSG and VCF Contacts {#Create-MSG-and-VCF-Contacts}

In this section, you will learn how to create an Outlook contact and save it in MSG and VCF format. The following are the steps to achieve that.

*   Create an instance of the [MapiContact][14] class.
*   Set the properties of the contact such as the Name, Address, Telephone, etc.
*   Save the contact using the [MapiContact->Save(System::String filePath, Aspose::Email::Mapi::ContactSaveFormat saveFormat)][15] method.

The following sample code demonstrates how to create an Outlook contact and save it in MSG and VCF format using C++.

## Read MSG and VCF Contacts {#Read-MSG-and-VCF-Contacts}

Aspose.Email for C++ supports reading contacts in both MSG and VCF formats. Here, you will see how to open MSG and VCF contacts using C++.

*   [Read MSG Contact][16]
*   [Open VCF Contact][17]

### Read MSG Contact {#Read-MSG-Contact}

The following are the steps to read an MSG contact.

*   Load the contact using the [MapiMessage][18] class.
*   Convert [MapiMessage][19] to [IMapiMessageItem][20] using the [MapiMessage->ToMapiMessageItem()][21] method and cast it to [MapiContact][22].
*   Read the properties of the contact.

The following is the sample code to read an MSG contact using C++.

{{< gist aspose-com-gists 1d5dbf0eb9b255417cefc38475b16b91 "Read-MSG-Contact.cpp" >}}

### Open VCF Contact {#Open-VCF-Contact}

To read a VCF contact, simply load the contact using the [MapiContact::FromVCard][23] method. The following sample code shows how to read a VCF contact using C++.

{{< gist aspose-com-gists 1d5dbf0eb9b255417cefc38475b16b91 "Read-VCF-Contact.cpp" >}}

## Modify MSG and VCF Contacts {#Modify-MSG-and-VCF-Contacts}

In order to modify an MSG/VCF contact, open the contact as demonstrated in the previous section and then change its properties. The following are the steps to modify contacts.

*   Load the MSG/VCF contact as shown in the [Read MSG and VCF Contacts][24] section.
*   Change the desired properties of the contact.
*   Save the contact using the [MapiContact->Save(System::String filePath, Aspose::Email::Mapi::ContactSaveFormat saveFormat)][25] method.

The following sample code demonstrates how to modify MSG/VCF contacts using C++.
