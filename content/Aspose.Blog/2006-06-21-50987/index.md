Dear Customers,

   We've released Aspose.AdHoc 1.5.1.0.

   What's new in this release :

*   New property "AutoDistinct" was introduced, by setting it to true, the query result will be distinct automatically and the "FilterCount" in the second page will be the distinct count also. Refer to: http://www.aspose.com/Community/forums/thread/47370.aspx
*   Fixed the bug in between function of Dutch version.
*   Fixed the bug in ParseSQL function.

   Thanks very much!
