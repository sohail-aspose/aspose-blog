![Aspose.Pdf icon][1]

We are glad to announce the release of another version of Aspose.Pdf for Java 3.2.0 which provides great support for TrueType fonts during PDF generation. The HTML to PDF conversion feature is greatly improved by providing support for some new style tags and we have also made significant improvement to the XML to PDF conversion feature. This new release also provides support for adding buffered images to PDF documents.

Please note that the current release of Aspose.Pdf for Java works faster than its predecessors, due to internal code optimization we've carried out to minimize the creation of temporary objects. We have alsoÂ introduced a new overloaded method setSystemImage(Component component) in the ImageInfo class that provides the capability to directly save Swing objects into PDF document.

Please visit the following link for further details on what's new & fixed in [Aspose.Pdf for Java 3.2.0][2].
