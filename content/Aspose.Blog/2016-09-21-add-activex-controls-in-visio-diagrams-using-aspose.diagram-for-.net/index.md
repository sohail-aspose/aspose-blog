We're pleased to announce that the new version 6.8.0 of [Aspose.Diagram for .NET][1] API is now live. The new version of the API allows developers to insert an ActiveX control in their Visio drawings and select or clear the CheckBox in Color column of the layer. They can also retrieve inherited fill data of the Visio shape. The recent version also covers a number of regular bug fixes and enhancements. Developers can install an Aspose.Diagram Nuget package in their .NET applications because we publish each version as [a NuGet package on the NuGet gallery][2]. We recommend our clients upgrade old version of Aspose.Diagram API to this latest one. For details on API fixes, please check Release Notes having a complete list of the features, enhancements and bug fixes.

## Insert an ActiveX Control into the Visio Drawing

An ActiveX control is a software component that adds functionality to an existing Visio drawing. Microsoft Visio includes several pre-built ActiveX controls on the Developer tab, including a label, textbox, command button, image, scroll bar, checkbox, combobox and listbox etc. Using Aspose.Diagram API, developers can now add ActiveX controls in their Visio drawing by specifying width, height and location. This help topic shows how to add an ActiveX control in the Visio drawing: Insert an ActiveX Control in the Visio Diagram

## Show or Hide the Color of a Layer in the Visio Diagram

Layers in Microsoft Visio provide a way to change properties of all shapes that have been assigned to a specific layer. Developers can assign a color to the layer using Aspose.Diagram API. They may also show or hide the color of the layer by selecting or clearing the checkbox in the color column of the layer. This help topic shows how to show or hide the color of layer while adding a new layer: Add a new Layer in the Visio Diagram

## Retrieve Inherited Fill Data of the Shape

In the Microsoft Visio, shapes can inherit StyleSheet and PageSheet elements. Using Aspose.Diagram API, developers can now retrieve inherited fill data of the Visio shape. The InheritFill property of the Shape class contains the fill formatting values for the shape inherited by the parent style and the master shape. This help topic shows how to retrieve the inherited fill data of a Visio shape: Retrieve Inherited Fill Data of a Visio Shape

This version also addresses the issues of missing shapes, tables and icons, the retrieval of the connections, preserve DPI in the output pictures, additional shapes, retrieve direction of the dynamic connectors and accuracy in alignment of the shapes. These enhancements and bug fixes improve performance and accuracy of Aspose.Diagram API. Please check a list of the resolved defects:
