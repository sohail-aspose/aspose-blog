I'm very much pleased to announce the release of the first version of the long-awaited merged Aspose.Pdf for .NET. In this merged version, we have combined Aspose.PDF for .NET and Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET. We have introduced a completely new DOM API as well to manipulate the PDF files. Please get a detailed idea from the post titled [Introduction to Merged Aspose.PDF API][1].

Now, you can use a single component to create new PDF files from scratch or edit existing PDF files. You may also incorporate the new DOM API to make your code consistent with other Aspose products and solve various complex problems. You may also find a detailed list of the features on the following pages:

*   [Aspose.Pdf DOM API Features][2]
*   [Aspose.Pdf.Generator Features][3]
*   [Aspose.Pdf.Facades Features][4]

The starting point to understand and learn the merged version is [documentation][5]. Even before that, you need to understand how the documentation is organized and how to use it in a better way; for that matter, please read the following topic: [How to Use New Documentation][6]. In order to understand the DOM API, you should have a look into the topic titled '[Introduction to DOM API][7]'. Also, the topic '[How to Use New Aspose.PDF for .NET API][8]' will help you get a hold on the merged version.

As the merged component contains three parts, the documentation is also arranged accordingly. You should check the respective programmer's guide sections on the following links:

*   [Working with Aspose.Pdf DOM API][9] - New DOM API
*   [Working with Aspose.Pdf.Generator][10] - Corresponds old Aspose.Pdf for .NET
*   [Working with Aspose.Pdf.Facades][11] - Corresponds old Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET

In order to edit PDF files, you can either use DOM API or Facades. You may [select any one of these two approaches to perform a particular task][12]; or you may [combine these two approaches to achieve your goal][13].

The migration from the old versions to this merged version is easy. First, you need to go through these posts '[Migrating from Legacy Code to Merged Aspose.Pdf for .NET][14]' and 'Video tutorial â€“ Migrate your current Aspose.PDF for .NET code to new Merged API' and then have a look into '[Migration to Aspose.PDF for .NET 6.x][15]' section of the knoweldge base in the documentation.

You can download the latest version from the [Aspose.PDF for .NET downloads section][16]. You can also download the [documentation][17] and [DLL only version][18]. However, if you download DLL only version, please make sure that you download the documentation as well, as the documentation is only included in the MSI version. If you find any questions or concerns, you may post a query in [Aspose.Pdf forums][19]. And also keep in touch through [our blogs][20].
