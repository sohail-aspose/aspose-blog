We are glad to announce a new release [Aspose.HTML for .NET 18.7][1] which can be downloaded from NuGet Gallery to be used in your .NET applications. In this version, we have improved the performance of HTML parsing module, up to 40%. We have also introduced a new vendor prefix -aspose- that allows customizing the behavior of CSS properties. Some other bug fixes and enhancements have also been included in Aspose.HTML for .NET 18.7. You can refer to the summary of public API changes and improvements in [Release Notes][2] of the API.

Moreover, rendering of an HTML file to a PDF document has been enhanced and you can repeat footer on each page of a PDF document. You can also add page numbers while rendering to a PDF format file. For further details about this, you may visit [Working with CSS Vendor Prefix][3].

Rendering of HTML documents to several other formats including EPUB, SVG, and MHTML has been enhanced and respective Renderer classes have been extended. Another enhancement to the Abstract renderer object allows you to render multiple documents into a single output device.
