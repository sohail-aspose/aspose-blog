## About ProHire

## Problem

ProHire uses Bullhorn ATS as its Application Tracking System to track the electronic handling of its recruitment needs. We wanted to integrate our website with the Bullhorn API with our new website. (Figure 1). When applicants have registered and have applied for jobs, then it was required to convert their word resumes to HTML. So their resumes were viewable within the Bullhorn ATS which is a browser-based application. So our goal was to convert MS Word Documents resumes into a clean and concise HTML format into our existing .Net Stack.

The converted HTML resume version needed to look close to the original (_thus, giving our recruiters an accurate representation of the resume_). The [Aspose.Words for .NET][2] product solved this problem by easily integrating into our existing .Net Stack, plus cleanly [parsing Word Documents to HTML][3] (_solving our problem_). This product affects our internal Recruitment Professional's perception of candidate Resumes thought our enterprise systems.

## Solution

We chose [Aspose.Words for .NET][4] product because it easily integrated into our existing .Net stack, and provided a quality [MS Word to HTML conversion][5]. The product was easy to download, and with a few lines of code, we were up and running. We found the primary difference between the [Aspose.Words for .NET][6] and other products was the obvious [conversion quality from MS Word to HTML][7]. (Figure 2).

## Experience

### **Finding a solution**

We had tested other products that converted Word to HTML. Everyone we tested had some problems with the conversion. Some of them lost elements of the resume during the conversion. Most of them changed the formatting of the resume or changed the color of the text unexpectedly. This was unacceptable because you need to send a resume to a hiring manager. After our experience with these other products, we installed the [trial version and tested the][8] conversion of more complex documents. We were very satisfied with the results. We did not need any [technical support][9] because [documentation][10] was sufficient for us.

### **Implementation**

Once we had the [Aspose.Words for .NET][11] API, our developer was able to implement the conversion procedure in a few hours. Some of the other competitors though were more difficult to implement. In one case, a competitive product we could not get it to work. The transitions with [Aspose.Words for .NET][12] was very painless to do

### **Outcome**

Using [Aspose.Words for .NET][13], we were able to have [word resumes convert properly to HTML][14] which displayed correctly in the Bullhorn ATS a browser-based application. This is important because we have a lot of candidates apply through our web site for jobs.

## Summary

We are very pleased with the success of our [Aspose.Words for .NET][15] implementation. [Aspose.Words for .NET][16] is a very powerful development tool that is [well documented][17] and easy to install. The [documentation][18] is easy to understand and use. If you want a product to [convert Word Docs to HTML][19], look no further. ProHire is happy to recommend [Aspose][20].
