We have published a new release of Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET. In Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET 4.4.0, we have improved PDF printing feature of PdfViewer class. We have also enhanced the process of extracting images from the PDF files. PDF to image conversion, Form, PdfFileStamp and Stamp related features have been improved as well.  
  
In this release, we have also provided a new feature to manipulate images in a PDF file. A new GetImageDescriptions method has been added in PdfExtractor class, which returns information of all the images in a PDF file. This method returns a list of the ImageDescription, which allows you to retain all the images related information. This functionality can allow you to get detailed information about the existing images and replace the images as well, based on this information.  
  
You can see the complete list of changes and download the latest version from the [Aspose.Pdf.Kit for .NET download section][1].
