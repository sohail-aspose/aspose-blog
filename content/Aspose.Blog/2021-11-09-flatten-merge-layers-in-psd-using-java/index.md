[PSD][1] images are commonly used to design graphic content like logos, posters, or drawings. PSD files comprise different layers for different sections of the images. In certain situations, you may need to work with the layers like flatten or merge the layers of a PSD image. For instance, you can flatten the layers to restrict changes to your artwork. This article covers how to flatten or merge layers in a PSD file programmatically using Java.

## Java API to Flatten or Merge Layers in PSD Image {#section1}

[Aspose.PSD for Java][5] API supports working with PSD along with different [supported file formats][6]. You can configure the API by downloading the JAR file from the [Downloads][7] section or with the following Maven specifications:

### Repository```
<repository>
    <id>AsposeJavaAPI</id>
    <name>Aspose Java API</name>
    <url>http://repository.aspose.com/repo/</url>
</repository>
```

### Dependency```
<dependency>
     <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
     <artifactId>aspose-psd</artifactId>
     <version>21.7</version>
     <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```

## Flatten Layers in a PSD Image in Java {#section2}

You can flatten the layers in a PSD image by following the steps below:

1.  Load the source PSD image with the [load][8] method.
2.  Flatten the layers with the [flattenImage][9] method.
3.  Save the output file with the [save][10] method.

The code snippet below demonstrates how to flatten the layers of a PSD image programmatically in Java:

## Merge Layers in a PSD Image in Java {#section3}

You can merge two or more layers in a PSD file with the following steps:

1.  Load the source PSD image with the [load][11] method.
2.  Get the layers from the input PSD file.
3.  Merge the layers with [mergeLayers][12] method.
4.  Set up the layers and save the output file.

The code snippet below shows how to merge layers in a PSD file with Java:
