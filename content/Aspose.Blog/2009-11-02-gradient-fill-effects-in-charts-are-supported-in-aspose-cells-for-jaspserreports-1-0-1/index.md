We have just released Aspose.Cells for JasperReports 1.0.1. The new version includes a number of valuable features regarding charts. For example, the Gradient Fill Effects for the areas are supported now including chart’s background (chart area, plot area etc.), legend’s background, bars and bubbles etc. The Axis labels (of Charts) in date format would be rendered correctly and accordingly. Moreover, the font sizes are adjusted appropriately to paste characters in Microsoft Excel format.

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
