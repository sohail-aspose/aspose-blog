Hot fix contains:  

*   Fixed: Margins between bullets and text on thumbnails.
*   Fixed: System.ArgumentException: "Illegal characters in path." on export to Pdf from Web applications.
*   Fixed: "PowerPoint found an error..." in MS PowerPoint 2000 after creating presentation by cloning slides.  
    Also adding new shapes and changing tables should be more stable after this fix.
