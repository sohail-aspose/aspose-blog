## Convert USDZ to STL File in Java

You can convert a USDZ file to an STL format file by following the steps below:

1.  Firstly, create an instance of the [Scene][8] class to load the source USDZ file.
2.  Initialize an object of [StlSaveOptions][9] class.
3.  Finally, convert USDZ to an STL file.

The following code snippet explains how to convert USDZ to STL file programmatically in Java:
