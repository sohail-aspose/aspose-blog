We have released Aspose.Flash for .NET 2.2.1. This latest version of Aspose.Flash for .NET allows you to work with ActionScript 3. In fact, it helps you load ActionScript Byte Code data from an ABC file and convert it to SWF file. DoABC class allows you to create DoABC tag from ABC data. You can also manipulate existing ABC data in an SWF file using ABCFile class. ABCFile allows you to manipulate different constants in the ABC data. It provides various constants arrays for this purpose. It also provides Dump method to convert byte code to pseudo code. We would also like to inform you that Aspose.Flash is compatible with Windows Azure, so you can use it on this new platform as well.

You can see the details and download the latest version from the [Aspose.Flash for .NET download section][1].
