We are pleased to announce the new release version of [Aspose.Diagram for Java 5.3.0][1]. We're gradually improving APIs to serve our clients in more appropriate manners. To lead the way, in this mini release, we have fixed some diagram export areas. The areas of improvement include VSD to PDF, VSD to VDX, VSDX to SVG and VST to VDX conversions. In addition to that, we have removed all Examples Dashboard stuff from this release version. For more details, please see our other blog post: Welcome to Social Coding and Goodbye to Examples Dashboard

## Enhancements in Visio Diagram Conversions

Utilizing the Aspose.Diagam APIs in the larger application projects is now a common phenomena. We have fixed some conversion problems based on the precious feedback of our clients. The brief description of the each fix is listed below.

*   Fixed: VSD to PDF conversion, our clients were facing the problems of changing font text, shape underline effects and incorrect rendering of date formats.
*   Fixed: VSD to VDX conversion, we observed a sample diagram which was opening perfect in Microsoft Office Visio editor, but causing an invalid XML massage while saving it to VDX format.
*   Fixed: VSDX to SVG conversion, we noticed a client feedback that the rendering of shape's hyperlinks was not working properly. It was specific to parametric URLs.
*   Fixed: VST to VDX conversion, we observed a sample Visio diagram where the VBA macro modules were not preserved properly.
