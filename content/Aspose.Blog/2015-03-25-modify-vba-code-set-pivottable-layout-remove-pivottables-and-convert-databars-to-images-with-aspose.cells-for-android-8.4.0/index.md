This release contains many useful improvements and features including the long awaited feature to manipulate VBA code embedded inside the spreadsheets. This release also contains some useful features and other improvements. Below, we list some major features and other enhancements in the new release.

## Access & Modify VBA Code

Many of the Aspose.Cells users had been waiting for this feature, and now it is available with the release of Aspose.Cells for Android 8.4.0. The latest build of the API has exposed a new package and a few classes to provide the means to access the VBA code embedded inside the macro enabled spreadsheets, and to amend the code as per requirement. The details of the newly exposed classes are as follow.

*   VbaProject class can be used to fetch the VBA project from a given spreadsheet.
*   VbaModuleCollection class represents the collection of VBA modules that are part of a given VbaProject.
*   VbaModule class represents a single module from the VbaModuleCollection.

Please see the document on how to access and modify VBA codes via Aspose.Cells APIs for your reference.

## Ability to Remove Pivot Table from Worksheet

Another worth mentioning feature is the support for Pivot Table removal. Aspose.Cells for Android 8.4.0 has provided this feature by exposing two new methods for the PivotTableCollection class that allows to delete a specific PivotTable from the collection depending upon the input parameter.

Here are a few details about the newly exposed methods whereas the code snippets are available in the detailed article as linked above.

*   PivotTableCollection.remove method accepts an object of PivotTable, and removes it from the collection.
*   PivotTableCollection.removeAt method accepts a zero index based integer value and removes the particular PivotTable from the collection.

## Support for Different Pivot Table Layouts

Microsoft Excel has predefined layouts for the Pivot Tables as listed below. Upon choosing any of these layouts, Microsoft Excel formats the Pivot Tables accordingly.

*   Compact Form
*   Outline Form

Aspose.Cells for Android 8.4.0 provides the same functionality while using the newly exposed methods for the PivotTable class that allows to dynamically set the layouts as discussed above. Detailed article and sample code snippets are available at Changing the Layout of Pivot Table.

## Convert DataBars to Images
