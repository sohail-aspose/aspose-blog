Here at Aspose we work hard to make developers' lives easier by providing easy-to-use, yet powerful APIs for managing documents of different formats. **Aspose.Words for C++** is one such project; that allows the developers to dynamically create, manipulate and convert Word documents without requiring Office Automation or Microsoft Word application. Aspose.Words for C++ 18.8 is a native C++ library which is now available for public use.

We are pleased to announce the first release of **Aspose.Words for C++**. You can either [download latest version of Aspose.Words for C++][1] API or [reference Aspose.Words for C++ in your Visual Studio project from NuGet][2].
