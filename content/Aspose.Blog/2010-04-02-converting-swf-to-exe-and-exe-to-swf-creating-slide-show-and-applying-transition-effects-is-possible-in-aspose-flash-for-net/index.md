We have released a new version of Aspose.Flash for .NET. In Aspose.Flash for .NET 2.7.0, we have introduced new conversion features, which allow you to convert an SWF file to EXE (projector) file and an EXE file to SWF file. You can find the working examples in the following topics:  
  

*   [Create an EXE file from an SWF file][1]
*   [Create an SWF file from an EXE file][2]

  
You can also create slide shows from images and apply different transition effects using this new version. Please find the details and examples in the following topics:  
  

*   [Create a slide show from a set of images][3]
*   [Apply a transition effect on an image][4]

  
You can see the complete list of changes and download the latest version from the [Aspose.Flash for .NET download section][5].
