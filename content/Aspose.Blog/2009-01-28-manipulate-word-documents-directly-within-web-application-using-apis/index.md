## About Marketing MO



{{< figure align=center src="images/SyfvEWtw_400x400.jpg" alt="">}}


[Marketing MO][1] delivers tools, documents and content for marketing, sales and strategy consultants. From the client area of our website, customers use our web-based software to create plans, manage client projects, store files, and access hundreds of best practices in 29 business subjects.

Our license gives our clients the right to use and re-use our best practices to deliver services under their own brand.

## Requirements Scenario

By the time when v2.0 of our product was available, our users used to download MS Word document templates directly from our server. Then they need to modify the documents on their desktop, customizing the content, fonts, and graphics.

However starting v3.0, we decided to automate some of this customization to shorten the length of time our consultants spend preparing documents for client work. Our requirements included:

*   Allowing users to upload their company logo to the application
*   Allowing users to [change the fonts of the document][2] download at the application level, instead of on each individual document; and then [inserting the user’s logo][3] into each Word document which s/he can download from our server.

## Solution Implementation

Aspose delivered all of the required functionality. Instead of building it from scratch, we’re able to install [Aspose.Words for .NET][4] in our application to handle these tasks starting our v3.0.

## Benefits

[Aspose.Words for .NET][5] saved us development time and the [support][6] gave us comfort that our developers will get assistance regarding any occurring issues.

## Conclusion

[Aspose.Words for .NET][7] has worked as expected, and we’re pleased we found it!
