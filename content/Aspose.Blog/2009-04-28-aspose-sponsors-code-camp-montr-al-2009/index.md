Aspose is proud to donate prizes to the Code Camp Montréal 2009. This will be its third code camp to date and will be held in Montreal, Canada on May 30th, 2009. You can find the prizes given away on the Tirages page. Most of the sessions (if not all) at the code camp will be related to Microsoft .Net technologies. This code camp is _free_ to all attendees and sessions will be held in English and French since Montreal is a bilingual city.

Eric, one of the organizers, mentioned that if you plan on going, make sure to register here: [http://www.codecampmontreal.com/MainPage.ashx][1].
