"We had a need in our application to export information to Excel. We looked at both Softartisans and Aspose. After review, we found that the Aspose.Cells was much more feature rich as well as better priced. Aspose.Cells was by far the better solution for our need. We greatly appreciate the wonderful product that Aspose provides and will always consider them first if a new need arises."
