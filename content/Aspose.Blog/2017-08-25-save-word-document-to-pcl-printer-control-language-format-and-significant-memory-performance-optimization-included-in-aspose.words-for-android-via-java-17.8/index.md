# Convert Word Document to PCL Format

We have introduced new saving format – PCL (Printer Command Language) in this version of Aspose.Words for Java. Aspose.Words can save documents to PCL 6 (PCL 6 Enhanced or PCL XL) format. There is one major feature of PCL that is unsupported in current version of Aspose.Words i.e. custom fonts. It is rather big and complex problem, but we will implement this feature in future.
