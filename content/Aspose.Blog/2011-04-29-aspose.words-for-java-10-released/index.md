**New Zealand, Auckland – April 29, 2011 –** Aspose has Aspose.Words for several platforms. The first product was **Aspose.Words for .NET.** Aspose.Words for Java came years later. We wanted the two products to be as similar as possible but to achieve this we had to manually port the .NET product, line by line, package by package, to Java. This was time consuming and tedious, our developers can be used better.

To get the two products in line, we developed a process for porting the .NET product to Java automatically. The process of [autoporting Aspose.Words for .NET for Java][1] started in 2010 and the Auckland team has been posting regular updates for months. Anyone who followed the blog will be aware that it was not a quick or simple project.

## Autoporting progress

Porting Aspose.Words from .NET to Java was no small feat. The project comprised 2,470 source files, all but 28 of which had to be generated from C# sources. Many could be generated easily, but hundreds needed manual attention before they would port correctly. The first Java compile was completed in November 2010.

The next challenge was to get all of the Java unit tests – over 9,700 – to pass. This important milestone was achieved in mid-March 2011, [after months of diligent work from the autoporting team][2]. A limited Aspose.Words for Java 10.0 Beta was released on April 1st. The first full release came April 29th. It took a long time to do the groundwork but we are proud to be in a situation where we can port Aspose.Words for Java in seconds. Our Java customers can look forward to a product that has most of the same features as Aspose.Words for .NET.

## New features for Aspose.Words for Java

There are a lot of new features in Aspose.Words for Java. Not all of the Aspose.Words for .NET features have made it across, but a huge number has. Here are some of the features that make this product extra special:

*   Field update engine (including evaluate table of contents).
*   Nested mail merge regions.
*   Support for WordprocessingML 2003 documents.
*   Support for MHTML.
*   Render to XPS and SWF.
*   CustomXML and Structured Document Tags support.
*   DrawingML roundtrip and rendering.
*   Footnotes and endnotes in rendering.

## What's next?

Having developed a tool for automatically porting .NET to Java, we want to use it. We have plans to extend autoporting to other products in the future.

**Edit \[14th February, 2012\]:** Aspose.Words for Java is ported automatically from Aspose.Words for .NET using a magical code porting tool which we use internally.
