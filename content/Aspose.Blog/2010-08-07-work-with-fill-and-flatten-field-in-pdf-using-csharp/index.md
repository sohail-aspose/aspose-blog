We have published [Aspose.PDF for .NET][1] 4.7.0. In this latest version, we have improved PdfExtractor, PdfConverter, Form, FormFieldFacade, PdfContentEditor and FormattedText classes.

The new version provides enhanced functionality of PDF to TIFF and image conversion. Form filling and flattening features have also been improved. Aspose.PDF for .NET team has also worked on improving the quality of text replacement and text extraction features. We have also introduced a new feature of setting font attributes while replacing text, which allows you to set font family, font size, font color and font style. FieldsNames property is marked obsolete in this version and you should use FieldNames property instead. The following two help topics have also been added in the Programmer's Guide:  
Encrypt PDF File Using Different Encryption Types  
Getting Page Number of a Particular Form Field
