[](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/06/aspose_slides-for-java1.png)[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/06/aspose_words-for-java.png)[![][2]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/04/apache-poi.png)We've created a new release of the Aspose for Java comparison to Apache POI WP. The new release, [Missing Features of Apache POI WP in Aspose 1.3][3], shows a number of Aspose.Words features missing in Apache POI WP (HWPF + XWPF).

The source code of these examples is freely hosted on popular social coding sites like [CodePlex][4], [GitHub][5], [Bitbucket][6] and [SourceForge][7].
