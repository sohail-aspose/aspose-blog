[DWF][1] or [DWFX][2] files can contain design data and graphics in one or multiple drawings and sheet sets. Such files are often used to the design data for review or approval purposes. Whereas, [SVG][3] images are famous because of their scalability without affecting the quality of the image. In some use cases, you may need to convert a DWF or DWFX file to an SVG image. Accordingly, this article explains how to convert a DWF or DWFX file to an SVG image programmatically in C#.

## DWF or DWFX to SVG Converter – C# API Installation {#section1}

Aspose.CAD for .NET API can be used to work with DWF, DWFX, and IFC formats in addition to other CAD-related [file formats][6]. You can access the API by downloading its DLL files from the [Downloads][7] page or install it easily with the following [NuGet][8] command:

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.CAD
```

## Convert DWF or DWFX to SVG Image Programmatically in C# {#section2}

You need to follow the steps below in order to convert a DWF or DWFX file to SVG image format:

1.  Create an object of the [DwfImage][9] class to load the input DWF or DWFX file.
2.  Initialize an instance of the [CadRasterizationOptions][10] class.
3.  Declare an object of [SvgOptions][11] class.
4.  Write the output file as an SVG image.

The following code sample demonstrates how to convert a DWF or DWFX file to SVG format programmatically in C#:
