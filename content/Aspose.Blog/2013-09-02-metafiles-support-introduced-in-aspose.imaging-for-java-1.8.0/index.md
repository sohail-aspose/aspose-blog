[![Aspose.Imaging for Java logo][1]](https://docs.aspose.com/display/emailproductfamily/Home)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Imaging for Java 1.8.0. In this release we have introduced the  metafile conversion feature. It also supports converting metafiles to other image formats. We can also extract TIFF frames from a multi-page TIFF image to any other supported image format.

This release also includes enhancements and fixes of the issues reported in earlier version. For example, PNG conversion to other image format and  resize method overloads fixed in this release in addition to other enhancements. To see a complete list of enhancements and fixes and to download Aspose.Imaging for Java 1.8.0, please visit the [download page][2].
