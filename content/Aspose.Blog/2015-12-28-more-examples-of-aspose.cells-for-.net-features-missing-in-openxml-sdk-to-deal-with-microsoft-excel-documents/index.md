We’ve added more examples in the release of the Aspose.Cell for .NET features unavailable in OpenXML Excel SDK. [These examples][1] show how different tasks can be performed using Aspose.Cells for .NET APIs in comparison with OpenXML SDK to deal with Microsoft Excel documents. This project is helpful for developers who want to migrate from OpenXML to Aspose or compare OpenXML with Aspose.Cells.
