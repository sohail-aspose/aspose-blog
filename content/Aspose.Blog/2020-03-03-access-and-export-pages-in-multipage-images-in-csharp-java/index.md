[Aspose.Imaging][1] has proved to be a powerful API for working with a variety of image formats. Along with single-page images, Aspose.Imaging also supports manipulating **multipage images** including **GIF**, **TIFF**, **PSD**, **DICOM**, **CDR**, and **WebP**. You can access pages of a multipage image and export them to a single page or another multipage image format. In this article, I'll demonstrate how to access pages in multipage GIF, TIFF, PSD, etc and export them to other formats programmatically in C# and Java.

## Access Pages in a Multipage Image using C# or Java

To access pages in a multipage image (GIF, TIFF, etc.), _Aspose.Imaging_ provides the _IMultipageImage_ interface. It allows you to get each page of the multipage image. You can explore more about the _IMultipageImage_ interface from the following API reference articles.

*   [IMultipageImage in .NET][2]
*   [IMultipageImage in Java][3]

The following code samples show how to access pages in a multipage TIFF.
