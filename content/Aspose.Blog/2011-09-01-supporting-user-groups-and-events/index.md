[![User group icon][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2011/08/user-group-icon.png)**Texas, USA - 31 August, 2011 -** Aspose supports a number of local user groups and events in the US. We are keen to support interaction and innovation and sponsoring user groups is one way in which we can do this. User groups are great for individuals as well as the industry: they get people together to learn, and to exchange and spark ideas. They are forums where people who share an interest get together, learn more about technologies and discuss technological issues. Professionals use them to develop their skills and students attend them to get a flavor of the industry. We look forward to doing our bit to encourage idea exchange and innovation. Below is a list of the user groups that we sponsor in 2011.

## Great Lakes Area .NET User Group**When**: Third Wednesday of each month, 6pm. **Where**: Microsoft Offices, 1000 Town Center Dr. Suite 1930, Southfield, MI 48075 We have sponsored the [Great Lakes Area .NET User Group][2] since 2010.
