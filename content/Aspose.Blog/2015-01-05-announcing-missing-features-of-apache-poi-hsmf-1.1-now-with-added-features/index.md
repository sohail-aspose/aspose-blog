[](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/06/aspose_slides-for-java1.png)[][1][![][2]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/01/aspose_email-for-java.png)[![][3]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/04/apache-poi.png)We've created a new release of the Aspose for Java comparison to Apache POI HSMF. The new release, [Missing Features of Apache POI HSMF in Aspose.Email 1.1][4], shows a number of Aspose.Email features missing in Apache POI HSMF.
