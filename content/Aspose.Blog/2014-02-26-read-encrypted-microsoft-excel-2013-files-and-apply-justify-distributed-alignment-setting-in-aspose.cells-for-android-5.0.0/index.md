[![Aspose.Cells for Android logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/06/aspose-Cells-for-Android_100.png)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Cells for Android 5.0.0 with new features, enhancements and bug fixes. This new release supports reading password protected Microsoft Excel 2013 files. We provide the Style.setJustifyDistributed() method so you can apply the justify distributed setting while applying text alignment settings on cells.

We also provide support for the B3 (13.9 x 19.7 inches) and Business Card (90 mm x 55 mm) PaperSizeType options.

We have added a number of enhancements and fixes in the new release. We have improved the chart to image and sheet to image modules. A few other improvements are also made to Aspose.Cells for Android's formula calculation engine. We have fixed a few exceptions when reading and writing Microsoft Excel file formats too.
