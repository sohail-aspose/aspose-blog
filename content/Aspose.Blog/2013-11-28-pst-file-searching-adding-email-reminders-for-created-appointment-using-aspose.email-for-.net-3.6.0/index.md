[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/aspose-Email-for-net_100.png)Aspose.Email for .NET 3.6.0 has been released with a number of new features and bug fixes.

PersonalStorage (PST) files can contain a huge amount of data and searching such a large file for a specific criteria may require including multiple check points in the code to filter required information. This month’s release supports searching specific records from a PST file based on user-defined search criteria. A PST can now be searched for messages based on search parameters such as sender, receiver, subject, message importance, presence of attachments, message size, and even message ID using the newly introduced PersonalStorageQueryBuilder class. The PersonalStorageQueryBuilder class can also be used to search subfolders based on specified search criteria. The article Searching Messages and Folders in a PST gives a detailed example of this new feature.

Microsoft Outlook allows developers to add reminders while creating a new appointment request. We are pleased to share that Aspose.Email now supports adding reminders to created appointments, which can then be saved as ICS or MSG file format. This means that it is possible to add audio, and display as well as email reminders to the created appointments as described in the technical article.

With this month’s release, Aspose.Email also supports setting color category information for messages. Moreover, adding multiple categories, reading categories information as well as removing categories is now supported.

We have also fixed a number of bugs reported with the previous version. For more details on what is new and fixed, please refer to the Aspose.Email’s [Product Download Page][2].
