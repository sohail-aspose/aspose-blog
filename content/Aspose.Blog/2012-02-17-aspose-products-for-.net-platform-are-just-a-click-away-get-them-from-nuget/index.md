![Aspose.Total icon][1]The .NET developer community is using [NuGet][2] extensively to search, install, and update a variety of packages from within Microsoft Visual Studio. NuGet is a Visual Studio package manager which allows you to add third party libraries into your .NET projects easily and quickly. [Installing NuGet][3] is quite easy while finding and [installing a package][4] is like a breeze.

We at [Aspose][5] also want to make things simpler, easier, and faster for you. That's why we have moved all of our .NET products to NuGet. Now you can get our [.NET file format components][6] quickly, either for evaluation purposes, or while starting a new project with your existing subscription; you can also upgrade to the newer versions of the components.

Here is a list of the [Aspose NuGet packages][7]:

*   [Aspose.Diagram for .NET][8]
*   [Aspose.Pdf for .NET][9]
*   [Aspose.Cells for .NET][10]
*   [Aspose.Words for .NET][11]
*   [Aspose.Email for .NET][12]
*   [Aspose.Tasks for .NET][13]
*   [Aspose.OCR for .NET][14]
*   [Aspose.Imaging for .NET][15]
*   [Aspose.BarCode for.NET][16]
*   [Aspose.Slides for .NET][17]

Our team has also added a complete tutorial on getting Aspose products from NuGet. In this tutorial, we have used Aspose.Words for .NET, however you can get and update other Aspose libraries in the same way.

You can still get the MSI and DLL only packages ofÂ  [.NET products from the download section][18]. We want to make sure that you have all the options which can save your time so you could focus more on your projects.

Give it a try and enjoy programming with our components! If you find any relevant questions or concerns, or have any comments, please share with us. We would welcome any thoughts and suggestions.
