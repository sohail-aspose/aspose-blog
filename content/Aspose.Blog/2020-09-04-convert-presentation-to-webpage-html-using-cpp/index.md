Presentations ([PPTX][1]/[PPT][2] are frequently used to depict the information to a large number of audiences. In this article, you will be learning how to convert PowerPoint Presentation to HTML Webpage. This use case can be helpful when the information is to be presented in a web application, website, etc. There are different variations of Presentation to HTML conversion some of which we will be covering here briefly:

*   [Presentation to HTML Webpage Converter API – Installation][3]
*   [Convert Whole Presentation (PPTX/PPT) to HTML Webpage using C++][4]
*   [Export Specific Slide of Presentation (PPTX/PPT) as HTML using C++][5]
*   [Convert Each Slide of Presentation (PPTX/PPT) to Separate HTML File using C++][6]

## Presentation to HTML Webpage Converter API – Installation {#section1}

This feature is a competitive edge for [Aspose.Slides for C++][7] API as it is not available even in Microsoft PowerPoint Application. Moreover, the output files are generated with great fidelity as the content appears the same as the input file. Let us install Aspose.Slides for C++ API to proceed with conversion demonstrations. You can easily download the API from the Downloads section, or from the [NuGet gallery][8] as explained in the screenshot below:
