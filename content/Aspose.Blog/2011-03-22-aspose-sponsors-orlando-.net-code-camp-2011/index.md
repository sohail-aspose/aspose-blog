Mark your calendar for March 26th, 2011 because it will be a full day of events at the Orlando .Net Code Camp of 2011. The camp will be held at the Seminole State College of Florida in Sanford. Events will take place from 8-5:30, but arrive a little early so you can have breakfast and register. This is their 6th Annual Code Camp. They will be raffling off prizes including 2 chances to win something from your Favorite File Format Experts, Aspose. Here is the official website for the [Orlando .Net Code Camp][1].
