*   [Convert STL to OBJ File using C#][4]

## STL to OBJ Converter – 3D API Installation {#section1}

[Aspose.3D for .NET][5] API supports working with different three-dimensional files. You can easily configure the API by downloading the DLL files from [New Releases][6], or use the following [NuGet][7] installation command in Visual Studio IDE:

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.3D
```

## Convert STL to OBJ File using C# {#section2}

You can convert an STL file to an OBJ format file with the following steps:

1.  Initialize an object of [Scene][8] class.
2.  Load input STL file with [Open][9] method.
3.  Specify the output format for the Wavefront OBJ file.
4.  Convert STL file to output OBJ file.

The following code shows how to convert an STL file to an OBJ Wavefront Object file programmatically with C#:
