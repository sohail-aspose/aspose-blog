We have just published Aspose.Words for Reporting Services 3.1.1. It is a hotfix that contains two important bugfixes. First, it addresses the long table cells problem reported by our customers. If your reports include tables with large amount of data spread over a few pages, you might want to install the hotfix to avoid incorrect export. Second, it addresses the invalid group page breaks placement that occurred for some relatively complex report design.
