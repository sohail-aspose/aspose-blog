OBJ files contain three-dimensional objects which can be exported to different 3D formats. This article covers how to convert an [OBJ][1] file to [FBX][2] or [STL][3] file programmatically in Java:

*   [OBJ to FBX or STL Converter – Java API Installation][4]
*   [Convert OBJ to FBX File Programmatically in Java][5]
*   [Convert OBJ to STL File Programmatically in Java][6]

## OBJ to FBX or STL Converter – Java API Installation {#section1}

[Aspose.3D for Java][7] API supports working with different 3D files like OBJ, FBX, STL, and several [other file formats][8]. You can configure the API by downloading the JAR file from the Downloads section, or using the following Maven configurations:

## Convert OBJ to FBX File Programmatically in Java {#section2}

You can convert an OBJ file to an FBX file with the following steps:

1.  Load the input OBJ file with the [Scene][9] class.
2.  Initialize [FBXSaveOptions][10] object with [FileFormat][11] instance.
3.  Convert OBJ to FBX file.

The following code sample shows how to convert an OBJ file to an FBX file programmatically in Java:

## Convert OBJ to STL File Programmatically in Java {#section3}

You can convert the OBJ file to an STL file with the steps below:

1.  Load the input OBJ file using the [Scene][12] class.
2.  Instantiate a [STLSaveOptions][13] class instance.
3.  Convert the OBJ file to STL.

The code snippet below shows how to convert an OBJ file to STL programmatically in Java:
