We have had a wonderful time in _2004_ and hope to have an even better time in _2005_. We have increased our number of [components we offer][1] remarkably in the past few months. **Keep up the good work!** Good luck to the developers who are trying to release new components right now. I wish great success to all of the members of the Aspose family, who are scattered all around the world. So, to all who celebrate the New Year, _have a safe and happy one_.

Sales,

Merit Cooper
