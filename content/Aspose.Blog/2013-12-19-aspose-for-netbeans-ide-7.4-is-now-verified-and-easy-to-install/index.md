[![NetBeans logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/12/netbeans-logo.png)Aspose Project Wizard is now available on [NetBeans Plugin Portal][2] and supports the latest version of NetBeans, 7.4.

This plugin helps you to explore [Aspose Java components][3] inside your favorite NetBeans IDE.

*   **Aspose New Project** creates a new project by downloading and referencing libraries of Aspose Java components.
*   Aspose New Project wizard allows you to select Aspose Java components like Aspose.Cells for Java and Aspose.Words for Java.
*   Once a specific component is selected, its reference is automatically downloaded from Aspose's servers and referenced in your project's classpath.
*   With this plugin, you never need to check for new releases of Aspose components. Whenever a new release is published, you are notified while creating project and you can also check release notes.
*   Once a project is created using **Aspose New Project**, you can add Aspose samples using **Aspose New File**.

For guidance on creating projects using Aspose Project Wizard, read Download and Use Aspose for Java APIs.
