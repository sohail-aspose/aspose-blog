Today, I will highlight the major features introduced in the [Aspose.Words for C++ 19.9][1] release:

## Create Repeating Section Content Controls in Word Document

The repeating section content control allows repeating the content contained within it. Using Aspose.Words for C++ 19.9, the structured document tag nodes of the repeating section and repeating section item types can be created and for this purpose, [SdtType enumeration][2] type provides RepeatingSectionItem property. The following code example demonstrates how to [Bind a Repeating Section Content Control in Word Document to a Table][3].

## Link Custom Document Property to Bookmark

'Aspose.Words for C++' API now provides a method [CustomDocumentProperties.addLinkToContent(String, String)][4] to create a new ‘linked to content’ custom document property which returns the newly created property object or null if the link source is invalid. The following code example demonstrates how to [Configure the Link to a Content Custom Property][5].
