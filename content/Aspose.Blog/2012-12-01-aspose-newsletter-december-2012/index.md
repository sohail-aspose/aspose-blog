## Aspose.Slides for Java and a Special Holiday Offer

If you've been visiting Aspose.com recently you'll know that we released Aspose.Slides for Java 3.0.0 last month. This is the first version of Aspose.Slides for Java that's been autoported from Aspose.Slides for .NET. We, and many of our customers, are excited about this release because it brings a host of new features to our Java users: printing presentations, PPT to PPTX conversion and support for charts, to mention some. From now on, we'll match each Aspose.Slides for .NET release with an Aspose.Slides for Java release. Our .NET and Java customers get the same features at the same time. It is a great step forward for our users and it's great for us too: we only have one code base to maintain so we can focus on new features.

To celebrate this release, this newsletter is almost all about Aspose.Slides. But before we give you tips and tricks on how to work with Aspose.Slides, I want to introduce:

### A Very Special Holiday Offer: 25% off Aspose.Total

Aspose.Slides is one of the products included in Aspose.Total. In honor of the holidays, we're offering 25% off Aspose.Total until the end of January. Simply quote **XMAS2012NL** [when placing your order][1]. (The offer is only available to new license purchases of Aspose.Total and cannot be used in conjunction with another offer. This offer is only available directly from Aspose.com, not through third parties or resellers.)

Thank you for reading,  
Danny Cooper, Aspose Texas Team Leader

### Product Spotlight – Aspose.Slides

[![Download icon][3]](http://bit.ly/pGWTWN)Aspose.Slides helps you work with Microsoft PowerPoint files from within your own applications. Use [Aspose.Slides for SSRS][4] or [JasperReports][5] to export reports to native Microsoft PowerPoint presentations. Use [Aspose.Slides for SharePoint][6] to convert PowerPoint presentations to other file formats, like PDF. Or use [Aspose.Slides for .NET][7] or [Java][8] to create, convert and manipulate presentations from within .NET or Java applications. Create slide stacks, automate monthly presentations, convert to images or change formatting, content and images. Aspose.Slides gives you the control you need. [Download a trial][9].

### Technical Article – Migrating to Aspose.Slides for Java 3.0.0

![Technical article icon][10]Aspose.Slides for Java 3.0.0 has a lot of new features. To facilitate automatic porting, we had to restructure the API and change a number of method names. To help you update your code, we've listed all the changes and written a detailed article about migration.

### Tutorial Video – Merging Two Presentations with Aspose.Slides for Java

[![Tutorial video icon][11]](http://bit.ly/QcIwh1)Aspose.Slides for Java has a clever system for merging presentations: simply access the presentations you want to merge and clone the slides to a target presentation. This video tutorial shows how to merge two presentations, bringing across both slides and slide notes, using Aspose.Slides for Java. [Watch the video][12].

### Migration Tip – Finding and Replacing Text with Aspose.Slides for .NET vs VSTO

![Migration tip icon][13]Sometimes, you might need to find text in a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation and replace it with a new string. Say, for example, that the name of a department changes, or a key member of staff is replaced. Instead of manually correcting every instance of a word or name, you can do it programmatically, saving time and effort. You can use VSTO but we recommend freeing yourself from Microsoft Automation and using Aspose.Slides for .NET instead. This tip compares the two techniques.
