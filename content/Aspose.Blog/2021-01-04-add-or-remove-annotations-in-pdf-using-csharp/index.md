In order to work with PDF documents from within your .NET applications, Aspose provides [Aspose.PDF for .NET][6]. Using the API, you can create new as well as manipulate existing PDF files seamlessly. Furthermore, the API also allows you to add and remove PDF annotations. You can either [download][7] the API or install it within your .NET applications using [NuGet][8].

## Add Annotations to PDF using C# {#Add-Annotations-to-PDF-using-CSharp}

PDF format supports various types of annotations such as text, line, circle, square, redaction and etc. In order to work with each PDF annotation, Aspose.PDF for .NET provides separate classes. For example, [LineAnnotation][9] class is used for adding a line whereas [HighlightAnnotation][10] class is used to add a highlight annotation. Let's have a look at the steps of adding any type of annotation to a PDF.

### Steps to Add Annotation in PDF using C#

*   Load the PDF file using [Document][11] class.
*   Create the instance of the desired annotation class i.e. [HighlightAnnotation][12] or [LineAnnotation][13].
*   Set the properties of the annotation such as position, color, size and etc.
*   Add annotation to the [Annotations][14] collection of the particular PDF page using [Document.Pages\[1\].Annotations.Add(Annotation)][15] method.
*   Save the PDF document using [Document.Save(String)][16] method.

For demonstration, the following code sample shows how to add a line annotation to the PDF using C#.
