A video tutorial is added to Aspose.BarCode for JasperReports documentation recently. Since, this is the first video tutorial in Aspose.BarCode for JasperReports documentation, we decided to show you the basics of adding an image to a report. Report can either be designed using iReport or it can be created manually. Then, we wrote a simple Java program to render barcode image to report and then export it to PDF format for easy viewing and printing.

The video tutorial is available at http://www.aspose.com/documentation/jasperreports-exporters/aspose.barcode-for-jasperreports/print-barcode-on-jasperreports-and-export-to-pdf.html.

Trial version of Aspose.BarCode for JasperReports can be downloaded from [http://www.aspose.com/community/files/67/jasperreports-exporters/aspose.barcode-for-jasperreports/default.aspx][1].
