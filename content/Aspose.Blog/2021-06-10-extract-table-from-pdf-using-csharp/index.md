[PDF][2] has become one of the most widely used document formats in a multitude of fields. In various cases, it is used to generate invoices where data appears to be in a tabular form. In such cases, you may need to parse the PDF to read data from the tables programmatically. To achieve this, the article covers **how to extract data from PDF tables using C#**.

## C# API to Extract Tables from PDF {#API-to-Extract-Table-from-PDF}

In order to extract data from the tables in PDF files, we will use [Aspose.PDF for .NET][6]. It is a powerful API that provides a wide range of PDF manipulation features. You can either [download][7] the API or install it using [NuGet][8].

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```

## Extract Data from PDF Tables in C# {#Extract-Data-from-PDF-Table}

The following are the steps to extract data from tables in a PDF using C#.

*   Load the PDF document using the [Document][9] class.
*   Loop through the pages in PDF using [Document.Pages][10] collection.
*   In each iteration, initialize the [TableAbsorber][11] object and visit the selected page using [TableAbsorber.Visit(Page)][12] method.
*   In a nested loop, iterate through the list of the tables in [TableAbsorber.TableList][13] collection.
*   For each [AbsorbedTable][14] in the collection, iterate through the collection of rows in [AbsorbedTable.RowList][15].
*   For each [AbsorbedRow][16] in the collection, iterate through the collection of cells in [AbsorbedRow.CellList][17].
*   Finally, loop through the [TextFragments][18] collection of each [AbsorbedCell][19] and print the text.

The following code sample shows how to extract text from PDF table in C#.

## Extract Table from a Specific Area of Page {#Extract-Table-from-a-Specific-Area-of-Page}

The following are the steps to extract a table from a specific part of the page in a PDF using C#.

*   Load the PDF document using the [Document][20] class.
*   Select the desired [Page][21] from [Document.Pages][22] collection.
*   Extract the Square annotation of the page.
*   Initialize the [TableAbsorber][23] object and visit the page using [TableAbsorber.Visit(Page)][24] method.
*   In a nested loop, iterate through the list of the tables in [TableAbsorber.TableList][25] collection.
*   If the table is in the region then perform the following steps.
    *   Iterate through the collection of rows in [AbsorbedTable.RowList][26].
    *   For each [AbsorbedRow][27] in the collection, iterate through the collection of cells in [AbsorbedRow.CellList][28].
    *   Finally, loop through the [TextFragments][29] collection of each [AbsorbedCell][30] and print the text.

The following code sample shows how to extract table from a specific region of the PDF page.
