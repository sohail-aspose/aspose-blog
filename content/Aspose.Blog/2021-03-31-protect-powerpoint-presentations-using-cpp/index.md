Microsoft PowerPoint is a powerful and feature-rich software that allows you to create stunning slides to use in your meetings and discussions. You might find yourself in situations where your presentation contains confidential information that you want to guard. In such cases, protecting the presentation file with a password can prove to be helpful. On the other hand, if you want to mark a presentation as final and do not want its contents to be modified, you can digitally sign the presentation file. As long as the signature is valid, you can be confident that the presentation file has not been altered. In light of that, this article will teach you **how to protect PowerPoint presentations with a password or digital signature using C++**.

## C++ API to Protect PowerPoint Files {#CPP-API-to-Protect-PowerPoint-Files}

[Aspose.Slides for C++][6] is a feature-rich C++ library that allows you to create, read, and modify PowerPoint files. Furthermore, the API supports protecting PowerPoint files using passwords and digital signatures. You can either install the API through [NuGet][7] or download it directly from the [Downloads][8] section.

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.Slides.Cpp
```

## Protect PowerPoint Files with a Password {#Protect-PowerPoint-Files-with-a-Password}

The following are the steps to protect PowerPoint presentations with a password.

*   Firstly, load the PowerPoint file using the [Presentation][9] class.
*   Encrypt the presentation with password using the [Presentation->get\_ProtectionManager()->Encrypt (System::String encryptionPassword)][10] method.
*   Finally, save the protected presentation using the [Presentation->Save (System::String name, Export::SaveFormat format)][11] method.

The following is the sample code to protect PowerPoint presentation with a password using C++.

## Protecting PowerPoint Files with a Digital Signature {#Protecting-PowerPoint-Files-with-a-Digital-Signature}

The following are the steps to protect PowerPoint presentations with a digital signature.

*   Firstly, load the PowerPoint presentation using the [Presentation][12] class.
*   Create an object of the [DigitalSignature][13] class using a certificate file and password.
*   Add comments using the [DigitalSignature->set\_Comments (System::String value)][14] method.
*   Add the digital signature to the presentation using the [Presentation->get\_DigitalSignatures()->Add (System::SharedPtr<IDigitalSignature> digitalSignature)][15] method.
*   Finally, save the signed presentation using the [Presentation->Save (System::String name, Export::SaveFormat format)][16] method.

The following is the sample code to protect PowerPoint files with a digital signature using C++.

## Verify Digitally Signed PowerPoint Files using C++ {#Verify-Digitally-Signed-PowerPoint-Files-using-CPP}

Aspose.Slides for C++ API also provides you with the ability to verify digitally signed PowerPoint files. The following are the steps to verify the digital signature of a PowerPoint file.

*   Load the PowerPoint presentation using the [Presentation][17] class.
*   Check for the presence of digital signatures using [Presentation->get\_DigitalSignatures()->get\_Count()][18] method.
*   If the presentation contains digital signatures, loop through them.
*   Within the loop, access each digital signature using [Presentation->get\_DigitalSignatures()->idx\_get (int32\_t index)][19] method.
*   Check the validity of the digital signature using the [DigitalSignature->get\_IsValid()][20] method that returns _true_ for valid signatures.

The following is the sample code to verify the digital signature of a PowerPoint file using C++.
