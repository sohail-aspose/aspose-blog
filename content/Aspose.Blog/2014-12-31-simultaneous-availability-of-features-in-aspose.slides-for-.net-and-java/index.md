[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We like to share the good news regarding improvement in release process for Aspose.Slides for Java which will eventually lead to simultaneous availability of features in both Aspose.Slides for .NET and Java.

At present Aspose.Slides for Java is ported from Aspose.Slides for .NET and there is one month difference between versioning of Aspose.Slides for .NET and Aspose.Slides for Java. With current mechanism the issues are first resolved in Aspose.Slides for .NET and then ported to Aspose.Slides for Java in next month subsequent release. The good news is that from January 2015, we will be releasing Aspose.Slides for .NET and Java 15.1.0 simultaneously in same month. This will reduce the one month lag time for Aspose.Slides for Java release and it will always be at same feature support level with that of Aspose.Slides for .NET. This will also be good news for our paid Enterprise and Priority support customers who earlier have to wait for more than month for their issues resolution in Aspose.Slides for Java.

As a result of this product release process improvement for Aspose.Slides for Java, the next version of Aspose.Slides for .NET will be released along with Java version from January. In the meanwhile, we'll provide a hotfix for any .NET customers for any urgent issues.
