We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Cells for Java 7.6.1. In this release, the dependency on the dom4j library has been removed. So, now dom4j-1.6.1.jar can be excluded from the classpath when using Aspose.Cells as we have written our own XML parser for certain operations. We have done a number of enhancements in the new release.

For example, we fixed an issue regarding set license, specifically the “Cannot find blacklisted licenses resource” exception as sometimes our users find this issue in their diverse environments. You may also use the product in OSGi environment without any problem now. We have resolved some exceptions when reading/writing Excel files and [rendering Excel spreadsheets to image files and PDF format][1].

This release is also a kind of maintenance release that contains certain enhancements and fixes for the issues reported in the earlier versions. In this release, we have fixed the issues for [manipulating charts][2] and shapes.
