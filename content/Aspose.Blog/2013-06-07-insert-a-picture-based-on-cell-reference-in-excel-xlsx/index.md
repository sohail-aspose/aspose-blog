[Aspose.Cells for .NET][1] 7.5.0 has been released. The new release includes a useful feature to add a picture based on your desired range of cells as its data source. We have added some significant enhancements for shading a style's fill effect for cells, opening CSV files with values longer than 32K in the cells and copying table and list object formulas accordingly when inserting new rows. We have fixed a few exceptions when refreshing PivotTable, saving to HTML and reading files.

In this release, several important issues have been addressed. For example, issues around rendering Microsoft Excel 2007/2010 file formats, rendering PivotTables, converting Excel files to HTML format, manipulating worksheets, applying formatting, rendering charts, rendering image files and exporting to PDF have been resolved. An improvement is also made pertaining to the formula calculation engine.

We have made a few enhancements and fix some bugs regarding cells sections and numbers formatting in the Grid controls provided by Aspose.Cells for .NET.
