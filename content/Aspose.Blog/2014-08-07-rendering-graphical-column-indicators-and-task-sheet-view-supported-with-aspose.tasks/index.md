[![][1]](http://www.aspose.com/java/project-management-component.aspx)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Tasks for Java 6.9.0. Ported from its equivalent .NET version, this month’s release includes the same enhancements and bug fixes. The public API changes section of Aspose.Tasks documentation can be referred for all the changes that are part of this release. The details of all the enhancements as well as other improvements can be found by visiting the Aspose.Tasks [product download page][2].

## Rendering Enhancements

This month’s version includes the following enhancements to the API:

**Graphical Column Indicators Rendering:** This month’s release provides rendering capability to render graphical indicators in columns during project data rendering to output PDF or other formats. These include task, resource and assignment indicators which show graphical depiction of available data values.

**Formatting Gantt Chart Bars Color Pattern:** This month’s release provides the capability for setting the Gantt chart lines color to Gradient instead of solid. The API empowers users to control this functionality using the SaveOptions class members.

**Rendering Task Sheet View:** With this month’s release, you can now render the task sheet view to various output formats, thus avoiding display of Gantt chart view in the output.

## Other Improvements

The latest version of Aspose.Tasks for Java automatically fixes all the bugs that were reported with the .NET version of the product. For a detailed note on the bug fixes, please refer to our product download page. In case of any query/inquiry, please feel free to write to us on [Aspose.Tasks forum][3].
