We have launched the demos of our Reporting Services products to demonstrate their capabilities. In fact, we have exposed the **AdventureWorks 2008 sample reports** of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Reporting Services so that customers can test their outputs before making a positive decision. Thanks to [Adam Cogan][1] for this suggestion.

The AdventureWorks 2008 sample reports are a set of predefined report definition files that use the AdventureWorks 2008 databases as data sources. You can export these reports using our Rendering Extensions for Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services to any one of the supported file formats.

You can find these demos at [http://www.aspose.com/demos/ssrs-rendering-extensions/default.aspx][2]
