[Aspose.Cells for Java][1] 7.3.5 has been released. This month’s release supports rendering sparklines and displaying RTL (right-to-left) languages in generated PDF files (Excel to PDF conversion).

We have added more methods (for example Validation.getValue1() and Validation.getValue2()) to obtain DateTime values for custom needs. Moreover, we have enhanced the performance of PDF rendering by providing the valuable PdfSaveOptions.CheckFontCompatibility option; the conditional formatting feature is also improved.

This release is also a maintenance release where several important issues have been fixed. Many issues around reading, writing or converting spreadsheets (XLS, XLSX etc.), rendering or converting shapes and exporting to PDF have been resolved. Issues pertaining to charts and the formula calculation engine have also been corrected in this release.
