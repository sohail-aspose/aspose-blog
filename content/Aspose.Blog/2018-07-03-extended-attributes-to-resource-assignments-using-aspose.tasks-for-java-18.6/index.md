We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Tasks for Java 18.6][1]. This release introduces a new feature of writing extended attributes information to resource assignments similar to tasks and resources. It also improves the overall API functionality by fixing issues reported with the previous version of the API. For a detailed note on what is new and fixed, please visit the [release notes][2] section of API documentation.

## Add Extended Attributes to Resource Assignments

Aspose.Tasks API already had the capability to add extended attributes to tasks and resources in a project. This month’s release introduces the capability to add extended attributes information to resource assignments as well. Extended Attributes can be added to resource assignments as plain as well as lookup values. The following examples show adding these two types of extended attributes to the project.
