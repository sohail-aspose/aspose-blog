We have released Aspose.Slides for Java 2.8.2, a hotfix and primarily a maintenance release. This hotfix ensures that presentations generated with Aspose.Slides for Java can be opened in PowerPoint 2007 SP3. Many of slide rendering issues that our customer have reported have been fixed and we have added support for rendering of SmartArt. A number of other issues have been fixed. We have looked at slide cloning and now support embedded videos in cloned presentations. The issue of table borders failing to render in saved or cloned presentation has also been resolved in this hotfix.
