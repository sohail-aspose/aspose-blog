Four of us from the Aspose.Words team attended the ODF Plugfest in Granada, Spain. Although it ended 17th April I got back home just now thanks to the volcano. Had to go back via Rome instead of London.

Anyway, I think we did well both for Aspose.Words support of ODT as well as for the OpenDocument ecosystem in general:

1.  We run all previous ODF Plugfest test scenarios via Aspose.Words, logged issues where needed and started working on them already.
2.  Made Aspose.Words available on Officeshots and run it on many test documents. At the moment this is off, but we will soon make Aspose.Words available on Officeshots permanently.
3.  Met with interesting people, all OpenDocument experts.
4.  Had a bit of our own teambuilding including the Arabic Baths. Granada is a great place to visit.

I have also uploaded the presentation about Aspose.Words and OpenDocument I've given at the event [http://www.aspose.com/community/files/51/.net-components/aspose.words-for-.net/entry234315.aspx][1]

Expect to see more improvements for ODT in Aspose.Words in the near future.
