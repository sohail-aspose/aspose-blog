We are pleased to introduce Aspose.CAD for .NET, our upcoming new API to work with CAD formats including DWG and DXF. CAD formats were already supported by Aspose.Imaging for .NET, but it has now been decided to give more attention to CAD related features and include them to a new API Aspose.CAD.

Aspose.Imaging for .NET has now been split into two APIs i.e. Aspose.Imaging for .NET and Aspose.CAD for .NET. CAD formats will be removed from Aspose.Imaging in next three months and all features related to CAD formats will be the part of Aspose.CAD only.

Aspose.CAD for .NET will allow you to create, read, update and convert CAD formats. First version will support reading and converting DWG and DXF formats to PDF and raster image formats, however, creating and updating CAD formats will also be supported very soon.

Following are the key features included in the upcoming first release of Aspose.CAD for .NET.

*   Convert DWG to raster image formats

*   Convert DWG to PDF
