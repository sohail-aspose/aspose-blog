## New Awards and Announcing Aspose.BarCode for SharePoint

At the beginning of the month we had some great news: for the seventh year running, we've received Bestselling Publisher and Bestselling Product awards from ComponentSource. The awards are based on sales and we're proud that our customers continue to invest in us.

We're also pleased to announce Aspose.BarCode for SharePoint, the latest member of the Aspose.BarCode family. It adds great new features to SharePoint lists - you'll find out more about it below.

As you know, this is a special year for us: we turned ten years old in March. We're continuing to connect to our early users and are delighted to share [a video from Keith Harvey][1], a software consultant with over 20 years experience of building great applications that are easy to use.

Thank you for reading,  
Danny Cooper, Aspose Texas Team Leader

### Product Spotlight – Aspose.BarCode for SharePoint

[](http://bit.ly/JpdCLF)Aspose.BarCode lets software developers work with barcodes in their own applications and add barcodes to documents. We're delighted to announce the latest addition to the Aspose.BarCode product family: Aspose.BarCode for SharePoint. With this easy to install component you can add barcode fields to SharePoint lists. Over 40 symbologies are supported. [Download it][3].

### Technical Article – Open XML SDK and Aspose.Words for Java

One of the questions that our users ask us is why they should use Aspose.Words for Java instead of the Open XML SDK. Open XML is free and it works, so why invest in something else? The answer is features and simplicity. Aspose.Words supports more file formats so you can do file conversion, it supports reporting, allows you to render documents for screen, to PDF or to print. All of this can be done in a few simple lines of code. But that's not all: read the article.

### Tutorial Video – Replace Text with Form Fields in Aspose.Pdf for .NET

The merged version of Aspose.Pdf for .NET (6.0.0 onwards) gives you great control over many different aspects of PDF documents. You can find and replace text, for example. This video tutorial shows you how to replace text in a PDF with a form field in 4:38. [Watch the tutorial][4].

### Migration Tip – Reading Critical Paths with Aspose.Tasks for .NET vs. VSTO

In Microsoft Project, the critical path is a series of tasks that directly affect the finish date of a project. When programming with Project files, you need to be able to read the critical path. You can do this using VSTO, or with Aspose.Tasks for .NET. With Aspose.Tasks, you don't need Microsoft Project installed: you're not dependent on other software. Read the migration tip.
