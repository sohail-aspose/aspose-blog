In January we ran a sweepstake where the prize was a small business developer license for Aspose.Diagram, Aspose.Imaging and Aspose.OCR for .NET. The winner was Enrico Keil, who has [Keil IT][1], Germany. Recently, Keil IT bought Aspose.BarCode and Aspose.Pdf for .NET to use with their flagship product, BarcodeOCR. They were kind enough to tell us about the project.

BarcodeOCR automatically recognises barcodes in documents and images and helps companies process scanned documents without user intervention.

Keil IT had a solution that achieved BarcodeOCR’s main purpose – automatic barcode recognition and document splitting – but wanted to improve its software so that it supported a wider variety of file formats and barcode symbologies, and was easier to maintain. A combination of Aspose.BarCode and Aspose.Pdf for .NET provided these features and improved performance too.
