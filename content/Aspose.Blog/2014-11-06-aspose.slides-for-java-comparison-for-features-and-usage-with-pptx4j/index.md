The project [Aspose for Java for Docx4j][1] shows how different tasks can be performed using Aspose for Java APIs compared directly with Docx4j for Microsoft PowerPoint and OpenOffice presentations, specifically Pptx4j. The project also covers the features that are only available in Aspose APIs but not in Pptx4j.

Some of the examples are available to [download][2] [![][3]](https://downloads.aspose.com/total) to give you a good idea of how the APIs work. Many more detailed examples are available at Aspose Docs.
