We have recently released Aspose.Network for .NET v6.3. In this version, we added support for reading and writing email messages to Mozilla Thunderbird's mail storage file. You can add/import new message(s) to the mail storage. Exporting emails from Thunderbird's mail storage to EML or MSG format is also added to this version. We also added vCard and ICS file formats support in this release. With v6.3, it is now possible to export contacts from MS Outlook PST file to vCard (VCF) format. Some bugs fixes are also included.
