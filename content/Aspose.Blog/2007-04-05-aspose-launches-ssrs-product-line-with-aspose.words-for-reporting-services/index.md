**Australia, Sydney – April 5, 2007 –** After the success of its .NET and Java product lines, Aspose has decided to release its products for SQL Server Reporting Services. The first product to be released on this platform is Aspose.Word, Aspose’s award-winning word processing file component.  
  
Aspose.Words for .NET has been on the market since 2003. In that time, the class library has won several awards and gone from a file format converter to a sophisticated tool for controlling and manipulating word processing files in a .NET environment. It is used by companies large and small to convert, change, mail merge, print and render word processing file formats from within .NET applications quickly and easily.  
  
_“Our customers have been asking for tools for Reporting services so we know that there is a real need for Aspose.Words for Reporting Services,”_ says Ben Li, Aspose’s CEO. The new product allows developers to generate true DOC, RTF and WordprocessingML documents from reports in Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services. All RDL report features, including tables, matrices, charts and images, are converted to Microsoft Word documents without loss of fidelity.  
  
Components like Aspose.Words for .NET and rendering extensions such as Aspose.Words for Reporting Services save developers days and even weeks of time developing and testing their own solutions. They integrate quickly with existing frameworks and give developers the power to get on with their main job: coding their company’s business logic and domain knowledge to help their users.
