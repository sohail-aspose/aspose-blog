![Aspose.Pdf icon][1]

We are very much excited to share the first release version of Aspose.Pdf for .NET in 2012. Feel free to explore the exciting features introduced in [Aspose.Pdf for .NET 6.6.0][2]. This release includes some great new features including SVG to PDF conversion, transforming PDF to PDF/A, rendering PDF into image format with desired dimensions, creating a PDF portfolio and determining if the source document is encrypted, before opening it.

There has been significant improvements to memory management when dealing with large and complex PDF files and converting PDFs into image formats. The component is also more stable when converting intricate HTML files into PDF format. You can now concatenate large PDF files and generate a resultant PDF around 1.0GB in size. Along with these improvements, we have made the PDF to DOC and PCL to PDF conversion processes more stable and robust. The product has been tested in a multi-threaded environment and it has proved to be a champ.

We have resolved a number of other issues too: we have improved the image/text replacement feature, corrected the rendering of PDF files to raster images, added support for more HTML tags, improved printing of PDF files, corrected the way that multi-line watermarks work and much more. To try it out yourself, download latest release version of [Aspose.Pdf for .NET 6.6.0][3] now.

For a complete list of issues resolved in this version and features being offered, please check out the release notes on the [Aspose.Pdf for .NET 6.6.0 download page][4].
