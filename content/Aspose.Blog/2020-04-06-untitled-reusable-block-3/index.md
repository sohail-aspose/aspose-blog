The transition from Bytescout Spreadsheet SDK to [Aspose.Cells for .NET][1] was extremely easy and took less than a day. There were no substantial challenges with using [Aspose.Cells for .NET][2]. We were worried concerning our large amounts of data, macros, and formatting, but [Aspose.Cells for .NET][3] handled all of those without any issues at all.
