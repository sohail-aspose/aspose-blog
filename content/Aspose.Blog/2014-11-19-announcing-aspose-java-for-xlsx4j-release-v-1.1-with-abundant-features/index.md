[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/05/aspose_cells-for-java.png)[![][2]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/08/docx4j.png)We've created a new release of the Aspose for Java comparison to Xlsx4j. The new release, [Missing Features of Xlsx4j in Aspose 1.1][3], shows a number of Aspose.Cells features missing in Xlsx4j.

The source code of these examples is freely hosted on popular social coding sites like [CodePlex][4], [GitHub][5], [Bitbucket][6] and [SourceForge][7].

This release contains a few new examples of features that are only available in Aspose APIs and not in Docx4j and related tools.

## What's New

*   [Convert chart to image][8].
*   [Create pivot charts][9].
*   [Export data from worksheets][10].
*   [Import data to worksheets][11].
*   [Sort data][12].

## Existing Samples

*   [Find value in cells][13].
*   [Calculate subtotals][14].
*   [Create charts][15].
*   [Set print titles][16].
*   [Convert XLS to PDF][17].

There is much more yet to come and many more examples with documentation are available at Aspose Docs. Keep visiting us.
