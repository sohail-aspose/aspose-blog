[![][1]](https://products.aspose.com/tasks/net)We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Tasks for .NET 6.4.0.

This month’s release includes a new feature that lets you export project data to the Primavera file format. This includes exporting project data to Primavera 6 XER and Primavera 6 XML formats. Users can now load a Microsoft Project’s MPP or XML files and export the data to both these formats with just a couple of lines of code.

This month’s release also improves the overall performance of the API by fixing some bugs related to recurring tasks detection. For more information on what is new and fixed, please refer to the [product download page][2].
