## Manipulate Conflict Pages in OneNote using Java

This release of API provides an enhancement where a page version from history can be identified as a [conflict page][3]. Conflict pages are skipped by default while saving the file. Using the API, if it is marked as non-conflict using the isConflictPage method, it will be saved as usual one in the history without being ignored as shown in the following code sample.
