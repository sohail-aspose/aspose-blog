[![We're getting very close to 200K users!][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/02/small-link2.png)In May 2010, user number 100,000 registered on our website. That was not quite three years ago and we're getting very close to celebrating 200,000 registered users. We're going to celebrate this milestone by giving away a number of prizes. Our 200,000th user will receive an Aspose.Total product family license: all our products, across all our platforms. It could be you.

## Recent Milestones

In 2012, Aspose turned ten. In the years since we released our first product, the industry has changed a lot. Demand for content grows constantly as smart phones, tablets and other devices become more common, and the infrastructure for delivering data improves. Many of the companies that have our products use them to deliver services and information on the internet and in the cloud. (We launched [Saaspose][3], a series of APIs for creating, converting and automating do document management in the cloud in recognition of this.)

2011 saw Aspose reach 10,000 customers. That means that 10,000 companies across the globe, in a variety of industries, trust us and use our products in their business. Whether they create sophisticated .NET or Java solutions that manipulate data and put them into templates, generate and recognize barcodes or simply need to convert between two file formats from within SharePoint, Aspose's tools are there to help.

## Aspose's Portfolio

So what do we do to have such a loyal following?

Aspose are file format experts. We create components and tools that help developers and systems managers who work with .NET or Java, SharePoint, Reporting Services and JasperReports, present documents and reports in the formats they want. Figuring out how to program with Microsoft Office formats is time consuming, and using Microsoft Office Automation can be slow and expensive. Our tools are powerful, efficient, and written with developers in mind. We save our customers weeks and even months of effort.

Aspose's initial focus was Microsoft Office components, specifically tools that helped developers work quickly without having to depend on Microsoft Office Automation. As we added support for more and more formats, we saw a need for tools that worked with Adobe PDF files, as well as components for functional areas, like working with email, images and barcodes. [Have a look at our product range][4].

We are proud to support a vibrant and busy community and look forward to reaching the next big milestone.
