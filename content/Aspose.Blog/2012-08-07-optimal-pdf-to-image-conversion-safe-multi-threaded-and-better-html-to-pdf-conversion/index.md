We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.PDF for .NET 7.2.0][1] with optimal support for converting PDF files to image formats. Please note that recently we have fixed many issues with PDF to PNG, JPEG, and TIFF conversion to improve the memory use and performance of this feature. The product has been tested in a multi-threaded environment. The text extraction feature is also improved to where it can easily extract non-English characters from PDF files. We have also improved the PDF printing feature.

Other improved features are PDF file concatenation, HTML to PDF conversion, PDF form signing, text stamping, PDF to PDF/A conversion, and many other features.
