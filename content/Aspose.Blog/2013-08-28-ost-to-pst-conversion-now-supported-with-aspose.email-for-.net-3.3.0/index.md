We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Email for .NET 3.3.0.

From time to time, we've received requests from our customers about developing an OST to PST conversion feature in the Aspose.Email library. We are pleased to share that this feature has been implemented. Users can now convert [OST to PST][1] and vice versa with just a single line of code.

This month’s release has also enhanced the capability of PST operations where users can now change a folder’s [Container class][2] after creating it. This enables users to view all the contents of the folder, that contains items of different types (messages, appointments, etc.), in Outlook by changing the folder’s container class to IPF.NOTE, for example.

Until this month’s release, users could use the Aspose.Email’s printing namespace to print email messages to XPS and TIFF, but there was no facility for adjusting the target DPI of the output images. This month’s release now supports [adjusting target DPI][3] for MailPrinter output, enabling users to create output images with high resolution.

We have also fixed a number of bugs related to MSG conversions to XPS, TIFF and MHTML in this release. In addition, this month’s release also includes some fixes for issues related to MapiCalendar and some encoding issues.

For more details about what is new and fixed, please visit the [Aspose.Email for .NET][4] release page.
