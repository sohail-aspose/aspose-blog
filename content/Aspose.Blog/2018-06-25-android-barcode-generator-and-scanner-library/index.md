[Aspose.BarCode for Java][1] has been in the field for a quite long time now and used by our valuable customers for generation and recognition of barcodes of different types. It allows the developers to quickly and easily add barcode generation and recognition functionality to their Java applications.

## Aspose.BarCode for Android via Java

After Aspose.BarCode for Java, we are now excited to share the news of extension in our [Aspose.BarCode product family][2]. This news is of interest to Andriod application developers who would love to incorporate barcode generation and recognition functionalities in their andriod applications. We are in the process of preparing & launching Aspose.BarCode for Android via Java. It has been built on top of Aspose.BarCode for Java. All of our experience in processing barcode goes into this new platform to provide quality API with high performance. In the launching version, API uses android.graphics instead of java.awt classes.

With the launch of [Aspose.BarCode for Android via Java][3], developers for Android will be able to develop applications capable of functionality offered by this API. These include:

*   Support of a large number of barcode types is present such as Code93 Standard, EAN13, QR, PDF417, DataMatrix, Postnet etc.
*   Control the size of barcode
*   Control appearance of text on barcode

Future versions of the API will support more formats such as WebP, GIF, BMP etc.
