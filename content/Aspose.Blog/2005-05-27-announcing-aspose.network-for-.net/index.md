**May 27, 2005 - Sydney, Australia** \- Aspose released Aspose.BarCode for .NET earlier this month. We are now in a position to unveil yet another product: Aspose.Network for .NET. Aspose.Network for .NET is a class library for working with emails from within .NET applications. It makes it easy for developers to open, save, manipulate and convert emails without the need for Microsoft Outlook or other email clients to be involved in the process. Network protocol programming is complicated and can be time consuming if you need to learn it from scratch. Aspose.Network handles it all on behalf of the user. Instead of getting to grips with sending calls up and down the protocol stack, developers call Aspose.Network and Aspose.Network does the work for them. Aspose.Network joins a long line of products for working with files in .NET applications without the need for automation. From Aspose.Words for working with word processing files, to Aspose.BarCode for working with barcodes in documents, Aspose's products provide features and functionality that our customers really need. As developers ourselves, we know how important it is to work with good products, produce easy-to-parse code and get help when you need it. We answer all those needs:

*   Our products encapsulate our file format expertise so that you can save the time you would otherwise use developing and testing your own solutions.
*   Our class libraries are powerful and easy to use, ensuring that the code you write to use them is as short and clear as possible. What you write today will be easy to understand tomorrow.
*   Our developers are responsible for technical support. No one knows the products better or have more need to hear from our users, than the people who develop them.

Aspose developers create products that they themselves are happy to use. We see that as the ultimate quality control.
