We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Note for Java 2.4.0][1]. This month’s release of the API introduces new feature of read/write support for Microsoft OneNote Notebook file formats (.onetoc2). It also provides the enhancement of determining Microsoft OneNote document format for differentiating between OneNote and OneNote online file format. For a complete list of all the features supported by the API, please visit the Product Release Notes for this month’s release.

# New Features & Enhancements

**Creating and Saving OneNote Notebooks:** This month’s release now provides the capability to create OneNote notebook and save it to disc. The Notebook class provides the functionality of creating new Notebook and save it to disc or memory stream using the save method.

**Adding and Removing Child Nodes from Notebook:** Not only you can create and save OneNote notebook files, you can also add and remove child nodes from a Notebook using the appendChild and removeChild methods.

**Conversion of Notebook to PDF:** The API also introduces new feature of loading OneNote notebook files and export them to PDF format. In addition, a notebook can be exported to PDF with additional options as well for specifying page splitting algorithm.

**Exporting Notebook data to Image:** In addition to exporting document data to PDF, this month’s release also provides the capability of exporting document to image format. It also allows to set output image resolution and flattening parameters. The flattening option, if used, lets you export Notebook children to a single output directory.

**Identifying OneNote File Format:** Aspose.Note supports Microsoft OneNote and OneNote online file formats; with the lateral having certain limitations such as lack of support for images and attachments in the document. With the provision of this new enhancement, user can pre-determine the document’s file format in order to be aware of these limitations. We are already working hard to implement the non-supported features for OneNote online file format.

# Other Improvements

This month’s release also fixes a number of bugs that were either reported with the Java version of the API or were auto-fixed after auto-porting from the .NET version of the API. These further aid to the stability of the API.
