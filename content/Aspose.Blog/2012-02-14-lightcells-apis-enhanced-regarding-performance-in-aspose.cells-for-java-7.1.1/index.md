Aspose.Cells for Java v7.1.1 has been released. This release includes a useful feature for checking if a column is blank. We have also made enhancements to the LightCells APIs so that you can now create huge XLSX files quickly. We have also enhanced the formula calculation engine and sorted out a few formulas. Moreover, we have improved the [Excel-to-PDF][2] feature.

There are some other fixes and enhancements too.
