We are pleased to announce our new 1.3.0 release of Aspose.Words for SharePoint!  
  
To download it please visit [http://www.aspose.com/community/files/73/sharepoint-components/aspose.words-for-sharepoint/default.aspx][1].  
  
The major improvement in this release is the integration with SharePoint workflows. After installation, a new workflow action named “Convert via Aspose.Words” is available in SharePoint Designer. You can use this activity to convert documents between supported formats and store the result in a desired SharePoint document library. Also you can use conversion activity output in other activities.  
  
Please use our [forum][2] to ask any questions you might have.  
  
Enjoy!
