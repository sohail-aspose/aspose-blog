[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png) We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Slides for .NET 15.8.0. This monthâ€™s release includes improvements that further enhance the overall API functionality. It also fixes a number of bugs related to rendering support which earlier resulted in an improper PDF.

## New Features:

The long awaited feature to get and set the size of the hole in Doughnut charts is now supported, as the property DoughnutHoleSize has been added to ChartSeries class. Please visit the documentation article Specifying Doughnut chart hole size for more details and sample code.

## Resolved Issues:

The presentation rendering support has been enhanced for exporting to PDF, PDF Notes and HTML formats. The issue of missing charts and its entities like charts legends in generated PDF and slide thumbnails have been rectified in this release.

We have also addressed the performance related issues to improve the performance of Aspose.Slides because some issues about memory consumption and memory leakage have been taken care of, and this release has improved performance as we have conducted performance tests on our end. We have also improved the support for presentation decks that were unable to be manipulated using previous releases because of the exceptions including NullReferenceException, OutOfMemoryException, PptxEditException and ArgumentException while loading and saving the presentations.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to the article Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes in Aspose.Slides for .NET 15.8.0 for further reference.
