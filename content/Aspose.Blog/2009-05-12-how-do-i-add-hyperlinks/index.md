WeÂ have created a video tutorial for the users. You can add all three types of hyperlinks to your spreadsheets using Aspose.Cells:  

1.  URL (world wide web) link
2.  Internal link
3.  External or file link

In this video, we create a simple Windows application to exercise how the three types of hyperlinks (mentioned above) can be added.
