Welcome to Aspose's July Newsletter

June was a good month for Aspose. In the first week we were listed on the SD Times Top 100. It is inspiring to be on the same list as household names such as Apple, Google and Microsoft. We also saw our online community population pass 130,000 users, firmly holding our position as the world's largest file format community.

Our support teams have been hard at work and we now have over 50 instructional videos, demonstrating a variety of ways to use Aspose libraries. We've seen a lot of interest in video so we'll continue to add more. If there are other training materials you would like to see please let us know.

Lastly, we've published two new case studies showing how Oracle and Red Gate have made use of Aspose products. Our marketing team produces a select number of case studies each year. If your organization has created an extremely innovative solution using Aspose products, please let us know: maybe we could feature you as well.

Many thanks,  
Danny Cooper, Aspose Texas Team Leader
