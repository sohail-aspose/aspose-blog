[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We like to share the release announcement of Aspose.Slides for .NET 8.3.0. This is primarily a maintenance release in which we have improved the performance and quality of the API. Many issues in previous versions have also been rectified in this new release.

We have improved the API by rectifying many rendering issues while exporting to PDF and slide thumbnails, including improper chart rendering, wrong background rendering, incorrect bullets and text rendering, improper image rendering and text overflowing slide size in exported PDF.

We have also rectified the presentation to HTML export issues whereby hyperlinks got lost along with improperly rendered bullets in the generated HTML file. We have also resolved issues pertaining to applying new slide master on slides which caused the images inside the slide to stretch while applying it during slide cloning. We have also rectified the issue for setting Alpha value for the shapes color in order to incorporate the transparency effect in shapes color.

To see a complete list of fixes and to download Aspose.Slides for .NET 8.3.0, [please visit the download page][2].
