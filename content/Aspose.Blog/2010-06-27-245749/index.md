It is with great excitement and pleasure that we can announce that we have registered our 100,000th user at www.aspose.com - making us the Worlds Largest File Format Community!  
  
Randy Bahrke of Multiview Systems based in Germany is our lucky winner and has been awarded an Aspose.Total Product Family license - Randy said, “It’s incredible never had I thought that I could be the winner. Really Really amazing”  
  
Multiview build software systems for large medical clinics across Germany, we asked Randy what he has planned for the Aspose product range, he responded.  
  
“I signed up to the Aspose site because I was looking for professional components in order to develop software faster, easier and more efficiently. I plan to use the Aspose products at first for a statistical application that shows charts and collected data from patients. The patients are diagnosed with ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and most are immobile at the end. The statistical application helps to visualise the acceleration and the progress of ALS in order to initialise a new or different therapy. Aspose has a huge collection of many many useful controls in order to realize this intention exactly. I am sure; I will love all the different possibilities that I now have available to build new complex applications.”  
  
So, what are you waiting for? -  Join the World’s Largest File Format Community today and like Randy, build complex applications faster, easier and more efficiently.
