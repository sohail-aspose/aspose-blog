We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Tasks for .NET 16.11.0][2]. This month’s release includes support for linking a task’s predecessor to external project. It also brings several improvements to the API by fixing bugs that were reported with the previous version of the API. For a complete list of what is new and fixed, please visit the release notes section of our documentation for this month’s release.

# New Features & Enhancements

**Linking Task’s Predecessor Information to External Project:** Aspose.Tasks for .NET already supports linking a project’s task to external project. This month’s release provides support for task’s predecessor information linked to external project in MPP file. This was implemented for XML project data format but was not supported for any version of MSP’s MPP Format. Support for this feature will enable MSP files to retain information related to external task such as source location and task identifier.

**Performance Improvement:** As always, we always try to bring improvement to the API functionality when it comes to performance while working with MPP/XML format files. Specifically, we have come across scenarios in past where recalculation takes lot of time in case there are large number of tasks in a project. This month’s release addresses one such concern where project recalculation took more than expected time. This has resulted in improved performance after the fixing of this problem.

# Other Improvements

This month’s release also fixes several bugs related to API functionality that were reported by our valued customers. This further brings improvement to the overall API stability and expected behavior.
