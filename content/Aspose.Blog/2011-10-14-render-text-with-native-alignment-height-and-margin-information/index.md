![Aspose.Pdf icon][1]

We have made great improvements in terms of rendering text object inside body, as well as header/footer section of the report. The new version of Aspose.Pdf for ReportingServices 2.3.1 has become much stable for text object processing. The text properties such as horizontal alignment, vertical alignment, text margin and TextBox height are properly supported and the resultant PDF is identical to the source .rdl report.

Please get your chance to download and try using the latest release version of [Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services 2.3.1][2].
