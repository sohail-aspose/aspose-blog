Aspose.BarCode for SSRS 6.1.0 has been released. We are pleased to announce that this release support dual signing with SHA-1 and SHA-256. There is no GUI change. The appearance of Interleaved2of5 symbology is now better because there are no addition lines around the code.

This new release has been upgraded in order to render the barcode within the image control. There are now fewer chances of error or a red cross image instead of the barocde image. This release also includes the most recent bug fixes.

To view a complete list of new features, fixes and enhancements [download the new release of Aspose.BarCode for SSRS][1].
