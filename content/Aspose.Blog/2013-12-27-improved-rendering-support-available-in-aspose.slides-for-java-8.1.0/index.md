[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-Java_100.png)We like to present Aspose.Slides for Java 8.1.0. This is primarily a maintenance release whereby we have focused over many presentation rendering issues. We have addressed issues like missing transparency effects, improper color rendering, improper image and text rendering in generated PDF and slide thumbnails.

We have also made improvement in rectifying the PDF and thumbnail rendering issues across different platforms including Window, Ubunu and CentOS.
