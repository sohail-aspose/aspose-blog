We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Tasks for .NET 17.9][1]. This month’s release is sort of maintenance release where several issues related to various API functionality have been fixed. Besides these fixes, this release also includes project data recalculation improvements. For a complete list of what is new and fixed, please visit the [release notes][2] section of API documentation.

## Improvements in Aspose.Tasks for .NET 17.9

As mentioned earlier, this month’s release includes fixes to several issues that were reported with the previous version of the API. These fixes add to the overall API stability in terms of expected output. Details about issues fixed in this month’s release are as follow:

**Documents Loading Exceptions:** Certain documents raised exceptions while loading with the API.  Fixing these now result in more stable API behavior in terms of loading Project documents.

**Recalculation Issues with Project Data:** The previous version of the API had issues in recalculations with certain project data fields such as Actual Finish date, project start date and summary task fields in specific user scenarios. This release fixes such issues, resulting in improved project data recalculations.

**Project Data Conversion Issues:** This release also fixes issues related to project data conversion to other formats. Specifically, exceptions were raised in certain cases where document was converted to PDF and image formats. Fixing these improves the API’s way of data conversion to other formats.

**Issues with Project Calendar data:** We have also fixed issues related to project Calendar data that raised exception while loading projects with 24 hour calendars.
