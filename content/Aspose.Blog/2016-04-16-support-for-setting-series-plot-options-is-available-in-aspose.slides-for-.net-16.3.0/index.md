[![][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/aspose-Slides-for-net_100.png)We like to share the release announcement for Aspose.Slides for .NET 16.3.0. This release comes with many new features and bug fixes.

## New Features

We have included the support for setting second plot options including SecondPieSize, PieSplitPosition and PieSplitBy so that second plot options for BarOfPie or PieOfPie chart can be set. Please visit the documentation article Second plot options for charts for more details and sample code. We have also included the support for exporting a presentation to PDF notes with custom slide size. You may visit the documentation article Converting Presentation to PDF for further reference.

## Resolved Issues

The support for rendering a presentation to PDF and images has been improved for images, text and slides notes. We have also taken care of issues reported for inconsistencies while cloning the slides, incorrect rendering of tables and misaligned or incorrect text in generated slides images. Issues including incorrect chart legends, improper chart axis, missing data labels and incorrect chart title have also been rectified. We have also resolved issues pertaining to loss of table and embedded data upon cloning slides within the presentations.

The presentation rendering support has been enhanced by fixing the issues related to SmartArt rendering, missing master slide and incorrect PDF notes. We have also addressed the issues related to memory leak, which has improved the performance of Aspose.Slides.

We have improved the support for presentations access and their saving that resulted in generation of corrupted presentations or presentation repair message when opened with PowerPoint. The presentation access and saving issues have been rectified for many presentation decks that earlier resulted in exceptions including ArgumentOutOfRangeException, ArgumentException , IndexOutOfRangeException, PptException, Unexpected Font Parsing and PptUnsupportedFormatException in previous releases during saving or loading the presentations.
