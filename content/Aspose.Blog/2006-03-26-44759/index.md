**Note:** All demos are available in both **CSharp** & **VB.NET** versions.

**Change Summary**

*   Aspose.Total Demos are modified to use the latest versions of the Aspose components
*   **Email Demo Application** is re-built to use the latest API changes in Aspose.Network.Mail component. (Old demo was using Aspose.Email component whose API was different from the newer component)
*   **Attachment bug** is fixed in Email demo application. (When a file was sent via email from other demo applications like Word Processor / Presentation creator etc. then the attached file was not opened on client side)
*   Adding Text Frame in Line shape throws exception in **Presentation Creator Demo Application**, which is also now fixed.
*   Aspose.Excel.Web is replaced with **Aspose.Grid.Web 1.5.2.0** to add more features to **Spread Sheet Creator Demo Application**
*   All demos using Aspose.ASPXpand 1.6.0.0 version are modified extensively to use the modified APIs of **Aspose.ASPXpand 2.0.2.0** (released on 9th march 2006)
*   An **Invoice Creator Demo Application** is added that takes input from user and generates an invoice in either **Word** or **PDF** format. Users can save the invoices to their computers or send to their email addresses directly. This demo application also utilizes the **Barcode** technology.
*   A **Flash Maker Demo Application** is also added that takes input from user in easy steps to add text or shapes with animations to create a flash movie. Users may view the resulting flash movie at the end and then can finally save or send it to their email address.
*   The **look and feel** of all Aspose.Total Demos is changed to make them look more attractive.
