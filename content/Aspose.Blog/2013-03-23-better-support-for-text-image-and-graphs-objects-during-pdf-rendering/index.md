We are pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Pdf for Reporting Services 2.5.1. This hotfix is a maintenance release that contains fixes regarding issues reported in earlier versions. In this release, we have provided support for rendering an image as cell background and ensured that text justification is honored during PDF generation. The product is further optimized for Microsoft Report Viewer 2010 and also offers better support for rendering graph objects when creating PDF documents.
