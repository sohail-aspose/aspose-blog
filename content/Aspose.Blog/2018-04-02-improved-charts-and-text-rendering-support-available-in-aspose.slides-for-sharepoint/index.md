[![Aspose.Slides for SharePoint logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/07/aspose-Slides-for-SharePoint_100.png)We are pleased to share the release announcement of Aspose.Slides for SharePoint 18.3.

This release has been developed based on Aspose.Slides for .NET 18.3,whereby we have included support for setting fonts in exported HTML. We have also improved API performance in different areas including charts, text and table rendering. The export to PDF and slide thumbnails has also been improved and this improved rendering support will contribute in overall API performance for exporting presentations to different formats including images, PDF and XPS when using Aspose.Slides for SharePoint.

We have made several enhancements to the new API. Please refer to [Aspose.Slides for SharePoint 18.3 Release Notes][2] for further reference.
