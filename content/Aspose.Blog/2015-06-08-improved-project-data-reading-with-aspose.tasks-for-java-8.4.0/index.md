We are pleased to announce the release of [Aspose.Tasks for Java 8.4.0][2]. This month’s release is sort of maintenance release where we have improved the API functionality by fixing a number of bugs. This further aids value to the overall functionality of the API and correct output results. There are no major API changes in this release.

# Functional Improvements

**Issues related to Project Calendar data:** Creating project calendar with 24-hours work resulted in wrong task start and finish dates. In addition, the API was also having functionality issue while creating a new calendar atop base calendar. Both these issues have been fixed in this month’s release.

**Exceptions:** This month’s release also fixes a number of exceptions while reading various Project MPP files. These cases were investigated and fixed to have improved reading capability of Microsoft Project files.
