## C++ API for Creating SmartArt In PowerPoint Presentations {#CPP-API-for-Creating-SmartArt-In-PowerPoint-Presentations}

[Aspose.Slides for C++][5] is a C++ API for working with PowerPoint files. It enables you to create, read and modify PPT and PPTX files without needing additional software. Furthermore, the API supports creating SmartArt in PowerPoint presentations. You can either install the API through [NuGet][6] or download it directly from the [Downloads][7] section.

```
PM> Install-Package Aspose.Slides.Cpp
```

## Create a SmartArt Shape in PowerPoint using C++ {#Create-a-SmartArt-Shape-in-PowerPoint-using-CPP}

The following are the steps to create a SmartArt shape in PowerPoint presentations.

*   Create an instance of the [Presentation][8] class to represent a new PowerPoint file.
*   Retrieve the desired slide.
*   Add the SmartArt using the [ISlide->get\_Shapes()->AddSmartArt(float x, float y, float width, float height, SmartArt::SmartArtLayoutType layoutType)][9] method.
*   Save the presentation using the [Presentation->Save(System::String fname, Export::SaveFormat format)][10] method.

The following sample code shows how to create a SmartArt shape in PowerPoint using C++.

## Access a SmartArt Shape in PowerPoint Presentation {#Access-a-SmartArt-Shape-in-PowerPoint-Presentation}

You can access the SmartArt shapes in PowerPoint files by following the steps given below.

*   Load the PowerPoint file using the [Presentation][11] class.
*   Loop through the shapes.
*   If the shape is of type [ISmartArt][12], then get its reference as an [ISmartArt][13] object.

The following sample code shows how to access a SmartArt shape from a PowerPoint presentation using C++.

\[gist id="0306bb6e0ef50710e2a4afb0e7261b10" file="Access\_SmartArt.cpp"\]

## Change the Style of a SmartArt Shape using C++ {#Change-the-Style-of-a-SmartArt-Shape-using-CPP}

You can easily change the style of the SmartArt shape after accessing it. The following are the steps to change the style of a SmartArt shape using C++.

*   Load the PowerPoint file using the [Presentation][14] class.
*   Loop through the shapes.
*   If the shape is of type [ISmartArt][15], then get its reference as an [ISmartArt][16] object.
*   Change the style using the [ISmartArt->set\_ColorStyle(SmartArtColorType value)][17] and [ISmartArt->set\_QuickStyle(SmartArtQuickStyleType value)][18] methods.
*   Save the presentation using the [Presentation->Save(System::String fname, Export::SaveFormat format)][19] method.

The following sample code shows how to change the style of a SmartArt shape using C++.
