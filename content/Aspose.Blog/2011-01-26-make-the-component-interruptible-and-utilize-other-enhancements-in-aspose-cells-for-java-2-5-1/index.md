We have released the Aspose.Cells for Java v2.5.1 for the users.

In this version, we have supported to interrupt open/save process while working with large files. We includes many new formulas (that are supported now) to the list. Moreover, you can get/set a shapeâ€™s absolute position in the worksheet. We have also enhanced/optimized the following existing features and modules:

*   Chart-to-Image
*   Direct Excel-to-PDF
*   Sheet-to-Image
*   Parsing/Calculating Formulas

There are some other enhancements and fixes too.
