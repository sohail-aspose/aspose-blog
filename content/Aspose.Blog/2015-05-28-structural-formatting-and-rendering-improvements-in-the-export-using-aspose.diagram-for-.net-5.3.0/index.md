[![Aspose.Diagram for .NET logo][1]](https://blog.aspose.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/06/aspose-Diagram-for-net_100.png)We're pleased to announce the new release version of Aspose.Diagram for .NET 5.3.0. This new release concentrates more on the officially reported issues. Our product team is committed to bring auxiliary improvements in performance, export quality, structural data formatting and many more. The layout and rendering with respect to the structures is dependent on how the Visio diagram is loaded. So, at the micro-level, we have improved the relationships among the diagram elements working.

## Quality Export of the Visio Diagrams

The export feature deals with the large data and we can conceive its significance. We're including fixes of the changing over element in the every new version, it's the huge territory to work with numerous record positions. So these fixes enhance Aspose APIs, quality, execution and customization levels. In the recent version, we have included majority of such features.

Our clients were facing problems of extra white space around the actual diagrams, the export of blank resultant PDFs, failed to preserve macro modules in specific cases, missing shapes, displacement of text items, images and border lines, etc. We have fixed these issues. Please look at the following noteworthy list of fixed issues:
